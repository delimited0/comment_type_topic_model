86516|~|Bob|~|I didn't know Madison but, if she is of Northern European descent, there's a 10% chance she had an evolutionary genetic predisposition to be clinically depressed, which a thousand years ago helped people survive long, dark winters. Depression generally causes one to do nothing thus conserving calories, which was useful during and before the dark ages when food was scarce. I have this genetic variant and, trust me, the daily struggle to live (rather than blowing my brains out) has absolutely nothing to do with the crap the author of the article fantasizes about. Conversations don't always help yet every article about SJW crap insists a conversation is desperately needed. Here's my story: I've had the same group of 8 friends since 3rd grade Cub Scouts. I would never put them through the pain of me ending my own life and, believe me, I've held a loaded pistol for hours wanting the relief it can provide me. I have to remind myself that depression is a lie. Get a good shrink but don't have conversations with random people about your depression because they don't have a clue what your talking about and, let's be honest, it hurts your chances for employment. The world doesn't care that you or I feel sad, nor should it. We all have our crosses to bear. Or I should say, we ADULTS all have our crosses to bear. |~|1|~|Wednesday, August 12, 2015 12:31 AM|~|2188005336|~|NA|~|1
86516|~|ShadrachSmith|~|Admissions essays are almost always sad, because intelligent young people of university age are just realizing that they are going to have to deal with a lot of pain and suffering in their lives. That creates the maudlin tone that the young have always embraced [eg John Green's The Fault in our Stars]. Happy admissions essays are prized as jewels among dross, because the next step toward adulthood is accepting that it is still a beautiful world. and you are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; and you have a right to be here and a chance to be happy. h/t Desiderata.

86516|~|Lee Jenkins|~|While I do understand how the narrative surrounding Madison’s suicide may be unfairly skewed (just Google the phrase, “Pretty White Woman Syndrome”), I think that there are multiple factors to consider.  This was a girl who literally seemed perfect.  Everything from her looks, talent, smarts, and personality.  The account of one’s suicide is usually nothing we haven’t heard before - he/she was depressed.  A broken heart.  Money problems.  Sexual assault.  Public shame.  But I feel like the stigma surrounding mental health has a lot to do with how individuals such as Madison are perceived from the outside:  “What does she have to be depressed about?”  “She was soooo pretty.”  “Her life is perfect.”  “I would’ve killed to have her talent.”  “She had everything!”  “How could she be so selfish?”  I can guarantee that most people (myself included) clicked a link to her story because it had a photo of her with her beaming smile.  It is unfortunate, yes, but it is getting more people to talk about depression and suicide.   If you watched the video accompanying the ESPN story, her sister Carli stated that Madison most likely stopped getting treatment because she “did not want to be a burden to anyone.”  So I think in this case, the coverage is not simply, “oh no this pretty white girl died how sad” but more along the lines of, “depression does not discriminate; it can happen to anyone.”  Madison’s loved ones, her friends, her coaches, and her teachers are the ones sharing her story so extensively, and they are not doing it as a way to show that her story matters more than the others…They are pushing it so that there won’t be any others.  They are raising awareness in order to show that getting help is a strength, not a weakness.  They are working to push laws into the senate in order to help decrease and ultimately prevent college suicides.  So whether or not you think that the widespread attention on this pretty white girl is unfair, the utilitarian results from it (the stories others have shared, the petitions, the charities, the college task forces) will ultimately lead to action that should’ve been taken a long time ago.|~|0|~|Thursday, August 6, 2015 1:23 PM|~|2177964075|~|NA|~|1
86516|~|Fidel Cashflow|~|Although I suppose your intentions are good, this article is one of the most bitter and vile ones I've read in a while. A girl with a loving family and promising future committed suicide. But even in death the author disrespects her by positing that the attention she gets is because she's white. Even in death, this girl is not safe from the social justice warriors. Is nothing sacred? Perhaps she gets a lot of attention because of the push by her family and friends to push for suicide prevention. Perhaps it's because of the reputation she had. You say you "sincerely apologize" if you failed to approach the issue without respect. Well, you didn't, regardless of how carefully you chose your flowery language.

86516|~|Please research more|~|Her story was so well documented, because her family members have become activists against suicide. Her family and friends are the ones spearheading fundraisers, remembrances, and suicide prevention/awareness in her name. I understand your intent in questioning the media coverage about the suicide of someone with a seemingly perfect life, but your research is not well-founded. Most of the reputable sources that have reported on her death involve testimonies from her family regarding their dedication to preventing suicide, using Madison as a platform. Please look into articles from North Jersey publications and media sources to understand the role of those closest to her in this advocacy.|~|0|~|Wednesday, August 5, 2015 2:59 PM|~|2176171797|~|NA|~|0

85938|~|More consideration required|~|This piece was undoubtedly written with good intentions. However, I believe the "problem" you highlight is a symptom of a far deeper pathology. As a result, your proposed solution can only serve as a quick fix. You assume that "our University already stresses certain values: perseverance, hard work, and intellectual curiosity." This assumption is tenuous at best (and sounds like it came directly from the mouth of the University spokesman). There's no way to truly know, but I'd estimate that the vast majority of students here view their majors -- and the courses required for these majors -- as a stepping stone to financial/political/social prestige. They "work hard" in their courses not primarily out of a desire to expand their intellectual horizons by as much as possible, but to improve their employment prospects to the greatest extent. Incentivizing students -- through awards or financial assistance, as you recommend -- may increase participation in community service activities. But it won't necessarily inculcate a greater sense of civic responsibility; students will inevitably seek out those opportunities which they believe make them more marketable. The net benefit to the community may or may not be positive. That's not the most important consideration. One has to ask: will Princeton students, through participation in Princeton's civic service programs, develop a sense of empathy with those in need? Most importantly, will it give them a sense of moral outrage, and allow them to see that the wrongs they wish to correct through community service are a consequence of the "high society" they've been conditioned to enter? For example, going on a service trip to help homeless people is great. But what intellectual purpose does it serve if they still go on to work at a bank that profits from foreclosures and evictions? Helping refugees is wonderful. But what good does it do if you go on to become an engineer with Boeing or Raytheon, companies that literally profit from war, violence, and death?|~|0|~|Wednesday, May 13, 2015 1:54 PM|~|2022734993|~|NA|~|0
85938|~|Completely Agree|~|On point! Even if Princeton students do community service out of purely altruistic reasons (i.e. it doesn't show up on their resumes), it's almost like a "study break" of sorts, something to take their minds off learning the "important" skills and taking the necessary classes for their future jobs on Wall Street.|~|0|~|Thursday, May 14, 2015 12:59 AM|~|2023855464|~|2022734993|~|0

85846|~|ShadrachSmith|~|Federal control of local police Race riots are part of Obama's political theater to empower the usual suspects to gruber data into the desired conclusion that every local police department  must  have a federal political officer with the ability to relieve the local commander on the spot. All good Social Justice Warriors will accept and empower that already scripted conclusion as revealed truth. And if you disagree, you are intentionally requiring the high moral duty of Social Justice Warriors to crush you like a squirrel in the road, because...Justice. For good and sufficient reasons the founders had different objectives. The history of the doctrine of  posse comitatus  covers all the arguments on both sides. Federalist 10 explains Madison's reasons for favoring local control. Obama doesn't care much for Madison's theories recommending local control of the government's use of force as a check on federal power, and we are all watching Obama's PR campaign to federalize the command of the local police.

Example, cheating is not illegal however it defeats the purpose of a learning institution so it is dealt with accordingly.  Rape unlike cheating is illegal and it erodes a sense of community and is a form of violence between students. Since rape like cheating affects the university's portrayal and student population, there should both be legal and extralegal consequences to such actions. |~|0|~|Monday, May 11, 2015 4:49 PM|~|2019111309|~|2011461584|~|0

85498|~|DeepThroat|~|The dissent is an embarrassment.  If this were a class paper, I'd give it a C.  If the University wants students to take sexual misconduct and sexual health issues seriously, a stupid cartoon is hardly the way to do this.  The audience is college freshman, not second graders.  The dissent doesn't even mention that.  And how is abstinence unrelated to sexual health?  One hardly needs to believe that abstaining sex is a good idea, or a moral one, to recognize that abstaining from sex is one strategy (and obviously the most effective) for avoiding STDs.  It is also one way of avoiding being in a situation where one might be the victim--or accused of--sexual misconduct.  (Please don't respond with the stupid "you're blaming the victim" nonsense. Just follow the logic.)  One hardly needs to be an Anscombe member or a prude to be able to recognize poor logic on the part of the dissenters.|~|4|~|Monday, May 4, 2015 3:27 PM|~|2002946999|~|NA|~|0

We'd like to pretend it doesn't, but attachments form, the safety of the emotions and the body are to be considered, promises are made (spoken or unspoken), and the possibility of creating a new life together is ALWAYS present.

It should also be about promoting a healthy sexual culture, and a fundamental part of that should be encouraging respect towards people who make different choices with regards to sex. As someone who entered the university planning to stay abstinent, the abstinent character in Sex on a Saturday Night made me feel included in something that was, at the time, an event I thought was entirely irrelevant for me.  Honestly, if he wasn't there, I would have been somewhat resentful that Princeton just assumed I would be having sex, and would have felt excluded from my very first week from any dialogue about sex.|~|2|~|Monday, May 4, 2015 9:20 AM|~|2002269945|~|NA|~|0

85498|~|BTR|~|"Abstinence is not a matter of sexual health; rather, it is a matter of personal choice and morality." Abstinence, like sex, has effects on health.  The choice not to smoke for moral reasons is similarly still one that involves health.  A campus with no sexual intercourse would certainly have a safe (in the context of STDs) sexual culture, and so the abstinence discussion is not only relevant, it is obligatory. Furthermore, the dissent is obliviously self-contradictory.  The University's definition of health is necessarily a moral issue.  Catholicism, among other religions, does not permit condoms.  Giving all students a condom may be a way to address sexual health, but underlying that action are moral beliefs on what constitutes a moral sexual ethic:  the University could alternatively promote sexual health by forbidding all sex, for example, or reduce rates of rape by castrating men or by forcing women to bear vaginas dentatas.  "How absurd!" the reader of my post may exclaim.  "Those are unreasonable, whereas condoms are not!"  And yet all of these are reflections of the moral values of those forming policy.|~|1|~|Monday, May 4, 2015 2:31 PM|~|2002843612|~|NA|~|1

85498|~|'16|~|abstinence as a choice is not worth discussing for more than ten seconds because if you are abstinent, the school has less to worry about when it comes to your sexual health. that is why the beginning of sexual education conversations--like those held after the freshman SHARE play--include a statement like "sex, if you choose to engage in it, and it is ok NOT to engage in it too, is healthy but puts you at risk in some ways..." there is always a brief mention of that choice being a personal one. but those who remain abstinent are obviously leading somewhat safer lives than those who do not. the university works to address the potential dangers for those who do not remain abstinent (which is a lot of people, considering we are on a college campus). obviously, being abstinent does not necessarily make you safe from being sexually assaulted. "the way you move" actually works to show this... the main female character has in fact never had sex before. throughout the play, she expresses uncertainty about hooking up with the main male character, let alone having sex with him. it is clear that she does not want to have sex with him, but he rapes her anyway. she is a student who has the desire to and the intention of remaining abstinent, but who gets taken advantage of by another student while she is intoxicated. the play engages with abstinence--and with all issues related to sex--in an intentionally nuanced way. sex-related issues on a college campus are never black and white, and the play wrestles with that fact.|~|0|~|Tuesday, May 5, 2015 11:18 AM|~|2005853422|~|NA|~|1
85498|~|ashamedstudent|~|I think its not about funny versus not funny as much as how does Princeton deal with other topics.  So let's look at the honor code. They instill the fear of an error into you, generally plagerism tends to directly affect you but if done enough over time could negatively affect the school's reputation. The punishment is from a forced leave of absence to expulsion. Onto rape, it directly affects the person raped as well as their close circle of friends, can cause a need for physical and psychological medical treatment, is a felony if convicted, in general is either hinted at or generally downplayed with no real punishment because unlike plagerism they don't punish people who are suspected. Seems like here at least the ability to rape 100% scott free is almost guaranteed if the rapist has sufficient funds.  we are going to use haha to explain what is and isn't rape to people yet we treat plagerism as if it were a direct sin to god.

The fact that he wasn't comfortable taking the case to trial where statistically speaking, he would most likely have been found innocent, speaks volumes.

85383|~|Not a perfect world|~|This would be a different conversation if the criminal justice system told us everyone who sold or did drugs, but it doesn't; it tells us who gets targeted and arrested for selling and using drugs. The second question is inseparable from racial disparities and discrimination. From the Drug Policy Alliance: "The drug war has produced profoundly unequal outcomes across racial groups, manifested through racial discrimination by law enforcement and disproportionate drug war misery suffered by communities of color. Although rates of drug use and selling are comparable across racial lines, people of color are far more likely to be stopped, searched, arrested, prosecuted, convicted and incarcerated for drug law violations than are whites. Higher arrest and incarceration rates for African Americans and Latinos are not reflective of increased prevalence of drug use or sales in these communities, but rather of a law enforcement focus on urban areas, on lower-income communities and on communities of color as well as inequitable treatment by the criminal justice system. We believe that the mass criminalization of people of color, particularly young African American men, is as profound a system of racial control as the Jim Crow laws were in this country until the mid-1960s." Note that there are NOT higher rates of drug use or sale in minority communities, but there are higher rates of drug prosecution. Moreover, "African Americans serve almost as much time in federal prison for a drug offense as whites do for a violent offense." The justice system does tell us something about the people who go through it, but it's not what they want you to think. http://www.drugpolicy.org/race...|~|1|~|Friday, May 1, 2015 11:21 AM|~|1997808825|~|1997553575|~|0

85387|~|'15|~|I'm very critical of the university's animal testing policies and hope for more transparency in the future, but there is a great irony in someone who works for an organization that kills thousands of animals every year while doing more to promote their brand through softcore pornography than actually helping animals having the nerve to call out another organization. But I guess that's what PETAs about; putting other groups down to build up your shitty version of activisim. So I will continue to love and support animals by being skeptical of, and demanding better from, the university while hoping your awful employer goes away forever and stops hurting, and profiting from, animal rights. |~|0|~|Saturday, May 2, 2015 11:28 AM|~|1999474644|~|NA|~|0

85223|~|Mohamed El-Dirany 2018|~|Hi, I'm one of the co-authors of the other article. Unfortunately, you seem to place a lot of information which is irrelevant to divestment, and in total is just flat out factually incorrect. You seem to try to conflate Ansar Beit Al Maqdis with Hamas, or to at least act as if they work together, yet we see in the facts that this is incorrect.  http://www.al-monitor.com/puls... As you can see from that, the two are actually rival factions that hurt each other. However, Hamas operates solely in Gaza, whereas Ansar Beit Al Maqdis is very much a group which operates in Sinai and flees into Gaza when needed. That is to say, that the crux of your argument, that there are terrorists in the Sinai, has no relevance at all to Gaza or the blockade. In fact, the blockade only ensures that Ansar Beit Al Maqdis is stronger. Of course, the most telling part of your lack of knowledge in this aspect is that you can't seem to find any real sources which say that this ISIS affiliate or any of the 15 other terror groups you say operate in Sinai work with Hamas or anything else. Probably because there are no real solid "links" to Ansar Beit al Maqdis and Hamas:  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-... In the end, you may have lived in Egypt, but you attempt to justify oppression without understanding that this oppression helps fuel the radical terrorism we all condemn. The root of the issue in the Sinai has been the destabilization of our government, with the revolution and then the ousting of Morsi, each time the attacks got worse. Then, we know that most of the groups get their weapons and more from the relatively loose Libyan border. It just disappoints me, Ahmed, to see you spreading misinformation in something not many people know about. Terrorism is a problem. But it only gets worse when you punitively hurt innocents who are unaffiliated. Those are the people on the border whose homes got demolished. Those are the majority of the 1.8 million in Gaza with barely enough resources to get by. Yes, there are terrorists in Gaza, but they aren't the ones threatening our country, and in fact, the terrorist threat to our country is built from the way we treat the people on the margins of our society, the way we treat our Bedouins, the way we treat our poor, the way we treat our hungry. This all leads to radicalization. Terrorism in Egypt is unaffiliated with the Palestinian human rights our government violates. This much is true, Ahmed. I know it, and hopefully if you read up on it, you will too.|~|2|~|Thursday, April 30, 2015 2:35 AM|~|1995443505|~|NA|~|1

85223|~|Arafat|~|So, Mohammed, it is "oppression" that fuels terrorism.  Is that so? Actually, Mohammed, it is Islam that fuels terrorism as can easily be seen if one opens one's eyes.  In fact Islam's prophet (the other Mohammed) was and encouraged terrorism.  The Qur'an, Hadiths and Sunna are literally littered with stories of his cruelty, torture, rape and killing of others. These Muslim holy books are also filled with verses and encouragement for Muslims to rise up against non-Muslims (filthy kafirs) and to take whatever means are necessary to subjugate the kafirs. It is Islam that fuels terrorism not oppression.  In fact the irony of your argument is that Islam is by definition oppressive.  Islam oppresses all people including Muslims.  Islam is an oppressive, repressive, threatening ideology masquerading as a compassionate and tolerant religion.  This is so plainly obvious, its manifestation easily seen in every single Muslim country, that it amazes me that anyone even takes you seriously.|~|1|~|Thursday, April 30, 2015 8:27 AM|~|1995761728|~|NA|~|1

85058|~|Jodie Wiederkehr|~|Regardless of what you consider misleading, the facts are that Princeton is cutting into the heads of animals, so similar to humans, implanting devices into their heads and restraining them in metal chairs to force them to perform ridiculous experiments for some juice.  I wouldn't call pain, fear, immobility or thirst positive reinforcement! I know, I know, according to animal experimenters, these monkeys are happy!  If a human wouldn't be too thrilled having their head cut open, having a post surgically implanted into their head, being restrained in a chair, having water withheld, etc., then neither would a primate! You can call it sterile and say that the experimenters followed all the proper IACUC-approved protocols and procedures with "great time, care and attention", but the fact remains that Princeton's experimenters are getting paid large grants to conduct experiments on wild animals enslaved in laboratories. You state, "At the University, laboratory-based research and teaching takes place with crayfish, frogs, golden shiners (fish), larval salamanders, macaques, marmosets, mice, rats and sea slugs. Of these species, 60 percent of the animals used in research at the University are fish and 38 percent are mice and rats."  Is the public supposed to be okay with that?

85058|~|Patricia Zambrano|~|I am totally against animal experiments and have been told that I am a “hypocrite” if I ever use medicines.  Such words are uttered by people who believe that the benefits of medicines that we enjoy comes from the fact that they were tested on animals. It is hardly surprising that they think that way as this is the brainwash that we have been subjected to by the industries that benefit economically from vivisection (which means experimenting on a live animals). Vivisection is a BIG money spinner. The reality is that the effectiveness of the medicines that we currently enjoy is derived from the fact that such medicines have a successful track record on humans and NOT to the fact that they were originally tested on animals. When a new medicine hits the market, is the moment when the real trials begin because the medicine is then administered to a wide range of patients of different ethnical backgrounds, gender, age, etc.  It is then when adverse reactions to humans manifest and it is a fact that the majority of new medicines have to be withdrawn or relabelled due to bad reactions on patients. By the time a medicine is withdrawn (and it can take many years to accumulate the necessary evidence to strike a medicine out of the market) the industry has made millions (or billions) out of it and many humans have paid the price through being maimed or killed by unreliable medicines which have passed tests on chosen animals. I say “chosen animals” because all species may well react differently to the same substance, however the ones that pass the medicine as safe are chosen as an example of the “safety of the medicine”.  The medicine can then go on to clinical trials on humans who are again carefully chosen such as young white males since this group has a lower incidence of adverse reactions.  However the next stage is to actually give the medicine to patients of all ages, gender, ethnical  backgrounds and that is the stage when the reality of adverse reactions becomes evident. So in answer to people who ask me if I take medicines I’d say give me the choice of a medicine developed purely through research based on human biology and I would very happy to try it because it is relevant to my species. I would never take a new medicine developed through animal testing because the chances are that it will be lethal to me.

85058|~|2016|~|Perhaps if more information was available about animal research at Princeton there would be more to draw from, for those writing these kinds of articles - and I don't mean a vague reference to the publications of the university -  At the moment things don't seem terribly transparent - Why aren't figures like the number of animals bought each year available publicly?  - Why aren't research methodologies (supposedly impartial and factual) written in full and explicit detail - (photos of assemblies could serve to shorten explanations, so that instances like the arm restraint chair/neck restraint chair/whatever restraint chair misunderstanding don't occur). If Princeton researchers and administration stand by their research practices, why not disclose these details? On that note - it seems nit-picky and misleading to make a big deal of contesting the exact means of restraint - Primates are not going to sit in a chair calmly and quietly whilst being tested on, in a psych study or whilst having their brains prodded around. If the chairs didn't have arm restraints then it's likely they had neck/head restraints, or torso restraints.  It honestly just sounds like they are appeasing an academic community apathetic to the fair treatment of non-human animals. As long as it doesn't sound cruel, exploitative, unethical then it's ok to carry on doing it - Is this really what a university is about?! It sounds incredibly dishonest to me - why do we study ethics if not to address these kinds of issues!? We ought not to have PR teams trying desperately to pass egregious and cruel acts off as clean and ethically uncomplicated, with euphemisms and references to government standards, so as to minimise valid lines of inquiry into what our research practices ought to be and maximise the number of publications. This article is misleading, it tries to distract from valid ethical questions with pedantic details that have no bearing on the broader question as to whether animals ought to be exploited to solve human problems.|~|1|~|Wednesday, April 29, 2015 10:33 AM|~|1993893684|~|NA|~|1

I'm pretty sure that once they undergo any procedures in the chairs with those head bolts that they would be far more unsettled and resistive than they appear in the video -  The video is certainly not representative of all of their interactions with the chairs and with experimentation/surgery.

They do however willingly get into the chair and allow themselves to be restrained fro the course  of the study.

A good example is some work on brain machine interfaces a few years ago, shich led directly to the successful evaluation of a prototype robotic arm in a tetraplegic women. In that study,  where the monkeys arms as well as their heads were (partially) restrained,  the monkeys were relaxed enough to quickly learn to control a robotic arm, but one monkey even figured out how to cheat to get the marshmallows more quickly  http://speakingofresearch.com/...|~|0|~|Saturday, May 2, 2015 5:03 AM|~|1999119415|~|1998917957|~|1

Any new rail service should extend to new destinations (e.g. Palmer Square) to make the upgrade worthwhile. The original Marvin Reed BRT proposal still looks like the best bang for our buck from a transit perspective, even if it outrages local railfans. By using the Dinky ROW, it could skip past traffic on Alexander, but also extend into town, and, hopefully, a few stops further north. It could also continue to Plainsboro at the south end.

I highly respect opinion writers of the Prince who are not afraid to put themselves out there and contribute to the vibrant freedom of speech that every university should have. However, I respectfully disagree for three reasons. First, I think you’ve fundamentally misunderstood the purpose of the As I Am Campaign. You seem to believe that our campaign was focused on “[convincing] everybody at this school that their body is wonderful and perfect.” However, if you’ve seen any of our pictures at all, you’ll realize that As I Am was actually aimed at providing a platform for people to share their honest feelings about their bodies. For example, students wrote things such as, “I’ve put my body through a lot but it’s still strong”, and “I feel that my body doesn’t reflect who I am on the inside and what I think about myself.” I fail to understand how any of these could be interpreted as an attempt to persuade everyone that they are perfect in society’s eyes. Your confusion may have stemmed from the name of the campaign, “As I Am.” However, even that doesn’t connote perfection by everyone’s standards. Instead, it is the idea that I am happy “as I am” – that I am willing to embrace myself just the way I am. Personally, I don’t think that’s a bad message. Second, you seem to be operating under the assumption that people don’t really care about their bodies. You wrote that a problem with As I Am is that “looking at picture after picture of students talking about their bodies and what they feel about them implies to me that my body is something I should be highly concerned with.” Although you may not care much about your body to begin with, I don’t think it is a ridiculous assumption to say that most people on this campus do care about what their bodies look like. Also, your argument that these pictures made you focus on how you eat is frightening – are you suggesting that perhaps we should never speak of body image on this campus? If we extend your argument further, if I had an eating disorder, I should never speak to my friends about my struggles, for fear that my friends also become self-conscious about their bodies. Perhaps you disagree, but I think that would be a fundamentally harmful norm to uphold in any community. Third, you seem to believe that instead of campaigns about body image, we should be doing campaigns about our positive traits independent of what we look like. The obvious flaw with that is that questions such as “Why do you love yourself?” and “What d o you believe makes you great?” would not address anything about our bodies at all. One of the main reasons for doing “As I Am” is to get people to start talking about body image as a very real and pertinent issue on campus, and we simply cannot do the same if we try to tiptoe around the actual issue and talk about our bodies. With your suggestion, we would essentially be sweeping a major issue at Princeton under the rug. Additionally, your suggestion of only focusing on the positive is concerning. A key part of what makes campaigns like What I Be and As I Am so powerful is that they allow students to open up about their insecurities, and through this open acknowledgement, we realize that we are not alone in our feelings and experiences. A campaign that focuses purely on the positive would negate this unique benefit. I understand that with every campaign, there is going to be some sort of backlash. Some people won’t find it valuable, and I accept that. But if you asked me if I would do “As I Am” again, I would say absolutely yes. I think we’ve achieved something really valuable on this campus through As I Am: we’ve brought an issue that is tabooed and hushed up into the broad daylight of campus discourse, we’ve provided a safe space for students to talk about their experiences with body image and eating disorders, and we’ve publicized the availability of campus resources for students who may need them. If that’s not a successful campaign, I don’t know what is. As always, I welcome further feedback, comments and questions - you can reach me at kchow@.

84736|~|Daniel Ebanks '15 |~|The current Sports Club Council, under the leadership of its current  president, has met with the new Director of Athletics in order to  secure more funding. The SC president has been a strong advocate on  these issues, and she deserves much credit for her efforts to gain more funding for  vital element of campus life to many students. This distribution of Sports Clubs funding is at the discretion of the Sports Club Council, which is elected by the officer boards of the various sports clubs.  They distribute this money at the end of the current fiscal year. This is a fixed fund and has not grown significantly since 2007, despite the tremendous growth of the number of Sports Clubs since that time. Additionally, the current clubs must defend every aspect of their budget in front of the student-run council when they place a request. The reason that new clubs are not given immediate funding is that the money has already been allocated for the new fiscal year. Appropriating funds Sports Clubs before they have demonstrated their capacity  to effectively manage their teams, negotiate with inter-league  entities seems unfair given that all other teams must go through this vetting process on a annual basis. The new clubs might fail, and other clubs which have already demonstrated their capacity to run a team would lose out on potentially vital funds. The growth of club sports is a boon to building communities on campus where students can be a part of a team environment, and I agree that the University should allocate more resources to Campus Rec.  Of note, Sports Clubs receive $300,000 to Varsity Sports' $21,000,000. There is one sports club administrator who must oversee 37 teams vs. the plethora of varsity administrators who manage to the Varsity program. Expanding SC administration could help facilitate more efficient interactions between student leaders and the University bureaucracy, but it should be noted that well-managed teams have grown and flourished despite this limitation. A final note on the size of the varsity athlete population: varsity athletics' participation rate is only slightly smaller than that of sports clubs. (Something like 17% vs. 18%) . And the required time commitments facing many varsity athletes is almost always higher than that of club sports.|~|0|~|Monday, April 27, 2015 10:54 PM|~|1991069382|~|NA|~|0

84545|~|Steve Swanson '15|~|Did you read my column, Max? It's a pretty narrow discussion of two competing theories of free speech, motivated by a recent protest in which some students agitated for a change in University policy towards hate speech. It's a reasoned comparison of the merits of the proposed policy change versus the present policy. I know it was 900 words, but it's probably worth it to read in full something that you're going to list as evidence of it's author's "discomfort with serious discussion about problems for minorities on campus." I conclude my column with, "if Urban Congo offended you, tell them why; tell other students why  they’re wrong; ask your classmates to boycott or condemn the show." This should have made it clear that I specifically oppose proposals to restrict speech on campus, not discussion of minority issues. You assert that the four columns you criticize are motivated by something beyond "mere philosophical commitment to free speech," but you provide absolutely no evidence in favor of this interpretation. A claim like that should probably have a pretty firm basis, considering that you're basically calling Christian, Newby, the Editorial Board, and me reactionary censors of minority speech. Although Christian can and probably will defend himself, your dismissal of his column is particularly egregious. You pull a quote (“I was dismissed because of my race and insulted because my opinion did not align with an absurdly overhyped narrative”) that, if true, is a clear example of intellectual dishonesty on the side that he's criticizing. Rather than actually tackle that quote, though, you just assert that he wrote his column out of a feeling of personal injury, claim that his column is "substance-free," and imply that "not 'fighting discrimination with discrimination' " is a risible or unworthy goal. Properly understood, my column is a comparison of two institutional definitions of free speech; Newby's is a more focused look at the response to Urban Congo and the calls for censorship; the Editorial Board's parses Eisgruber's recent email; and Christian's is about intellectually honest, civil discourse (in fact largely side stepping the role of the University or definition of free speech). These are by no means "very similar" except in that they all take issue with the substance or tone of the Urban Congo debate. If you truly believe that we can't disagree with an explicit request for restriction of free speech without evincing our ugly, reactionary, prejudice, then maybe my hope for reasoned discourse on this campus was unfounded.|~|4|~|Thursday, April 23, 2015 10:08 AM|~|1983193095|~|NA|~|1

84545|~|Max Grear|~|Hey Steve. Yeah, I read your column. For the record, I found it pretty interesting in terms of the discussion of different conceptions of free speech.  As I stated in the article, I also adhere to a liberal definition of free speech. I also disagree with some of the calls that people have made, protesters included, to place some restrictions on free speech. To be clear, I stop far short of accusing any of you of being "censors of minority speech." Neither do I accuse any of you of having "ugly, reactionary instincts." I accused you of ignoring these kind of instincts that, when manifested anonymously, become the real threat to freedom of speech. As you write, the columns that I mention are similar "in that they all take issue with the substance or tone of the Urban Congo debate." This is the crux of my argument: I don't disagree with any of you on a philosophical level about the importance of free speech, but I take issue with the fact that you all took the opportunity to criticize this small group of protesting students. One column would not have been enough to support the claims I make, but the fact that you were all motivated to react with a defense of free speech suggests that you took this small group of students as representative of an actual threat to free speech. The implication here is that efforts to improve the campus environment for minority students could actually lead to institutional censorship, an idea with which I strongly disagree. We're far from that point.  I never accuse any of you of individual prejudice. Instead, I argue that your collective reaction is indicative of a broader feeling of discomfort with meaningful conversation about race. I stand by my dismissal of Christian's column. Yes, obviously discrimination is bad. Everyone should also be nice to each other all the time, and respect each other's opinions. But any column devoted to arguing essentially that point (and I honestly don't think I'm unfairly over-simplifying Christian's article here) is a waste of time. And yes, devoting 850 words to arguing against fighting discrimination with discrimination is pointless, just as any argument invoking that mythical concept of "reverse-racism" is worthless.|~|0|~|Thursday, April 23, 2015 7:57 PM|~|1984226009|~|1983193095|~|1
84545|~|Steve Swanson '15|~|It's true that you never applied the phrases "ugly, reactionary instincts" or "censors of minority speech" to any of us, and I never said that you did. You certainly did, though, claim that all of our motivations went "beyond a mere philosophical commitment to free speech" to "discomfort with serious discussion about problems for minorities on campus." The implication is that the three columnists named, as well as the Editorial Board, were trying to shut down a minority group based on some prejudice we all hold, rather than trying to rationally disagree with ideas expressed by this group. I therefore feel comfortable, if a bit hyperbolic, summarizing your characterization of us as "censors of minority speech." Maybe I just don't understand the "crux of your argument," as stated in the original column or in the comment above. I can only speak for myself when I say that yes, I do see people explicitly arguing in favor of restricting speech as a threat to free speech. Especially considering that the Princeton policies prior to the recent affirmation of academic freedom (and maybe still -- I don't really understand the quasi-legal disciplinary system here) in fact did restrict hate speech, it is entirely reasonable to speak out against censorship, real or potential. I don't think that efforts to improve the campus for minorities necessarily will end in institutional censorship, but I do think that people who are directly agitating for institutional censorship might. I would guess that Newby and the Editorial Board would express similar opinions. You seem to think that I and the others responded to this "small group of brave students" not because of the ideas they expressed, but because of their identity. Have you considered that the response against the proposed restriction of speech was so strong not because of the prejudice of us white male writers, but because opinion columnists tend to hold free speech and open discourse in high regard? Your claim not to have accused any of us of individual prejudice is silly -- if our "collective reaction" is due to a "broader feeling of discomfort with meaningful conversation about race," doesn't that imply that we have this feeling of discomfort, as well? Doesn't that feeling of discomfort necessarily come from prejudice? If I say all freshmen are terrible writers, I'm accusing you of being a terrible writer, even if I say it's part of a "broader trend." Again, I bet Christian will come out swinging with a 900-word comment sometime in the near future, so I won't step on his toes too much. But you should realize that the accusation of discomfort with conversations about race based upon his most recent column is entirely unfounded. His whole column is about an attempt to engage in such a meaningful conversation about race over Facebook and being dismissed and denied repeatedly. And if you want to say that speaking out against "fighting discrimination with discrimination," as well as against "reverse-racism" is worthless, I would advise you to write a full column explaining these views -- obviously neither Christian nor I see what is apparently so clearly wrong with it.|~|1|~|Thursday, April 23, 2015 8:40 PM|~|1984276472|~|1984226009|~|1

84545|~|Max Grear|~|I'll just add a few things, because I think that there are so more fundamental disagreements at stake. I'd be happy to talk in person about this. "Meaningful conversation," the way I see it, has certain conditions. The first is that parties come into the conversation with a reasonable base of understanding about a particular issue. There is a wealth of information out there about problems like cultural appropriation. Another condition is that those of us with privilege don't overreact when someone points out this privilege. Finally, we need to be empathetic and tactful—and realize that we should accept the legitimacy of the feelings of students who feel marginalized on a regular basis because of their identities, and be careful when we ask about why a particular incident might be harmful (especially right after it has happened). I honestly think that a lot of people are unfamiliar and uncomfortable with this kind of conversation.|~|0|~|Thursday, April 23, 2015 9:12 PM|~|1984311828|~|1984276472|~|1
84545|~|Christian Wawrzonek '16|~|I would also be happy to engage in a discussion in person if such a discussion takes place. As an aside, Steve and I made similar attempts to engage those offended by urban congo in person over coffee, but were sarcastically dismissed. So if you truly are open to having a discussion in person, you are already a step above many others on this campus. Now to your comment, it is intellectually void to assume that those you are talking to have not done substantial research simply because they disagree with you. Believe me when I say that Steve and I discuss and read about these issues far more than any sane person would. And in doing this research, we have come to different conclusions. There is real value in engaging with those who have differing opinions. Perhaps  I missed something about the opposing argument when I did my research, or perhaps I'm unfairly biased in my information gathering. The most important reason is of course, as you have pointed out, that others have different perspectives, which is especially true in racial issues. Do not assume that just because I have attempted to engage means that I did not do any of my own research.|~|0|~|Friday, April 24, 2015 12:44 AM|~|1984511253|~|1984311828|~|1
84545|~|Max Grear|~|This was actually something that I found a bit confusing about your article. I wan't sure if you were trying to say that you were asking for clarification on why the Urban Congo incident may be hurtful to some students—as if you genuinely weren't sure about the reasons why this kind of occurrence might be offensive—or if you were aware but skeptical of these reasons. Sounds like it is the latter case. I'm not sure why exactly you may be skeptical about, for example, things like cultural appropriation (that's not the focus of your article, I get that). Or maybe that's not specifically the object of your skepticism. But we should always be careful about trying to take a detached, purely rational approach to issues that truly pertain to the emotional, lived experience of so many students. That's not to say that we shouldn't attempt to participate in reasonable, rational conversation about controversial issues—but to engage meaningfully in cases like the recent Urban Congo conversation, we need to engage at least somewhat on the terms of those with the most at stake. This means that we may have to accept for the purpose of dialogue—even if we have deeper reservations—that something like cultural appropriation is a real phenomenon. This requires a certain humility that makes many of us with privilege, myself included, uncomfortable at times. We can still have meaningful conversations about cultural appropriation, etc. more generally in the right context. But it just seems a bit naive and oblivious to try to raise questions about the legitimacy of cultural appropriation or whatever on Facebook (already a poor forum for meaningful discussion about controversial issues), at a time when some students are hurt enough to organize a protest, and then write a column bemoaning the emotional and irrational character of the conversation.|~|0|~|Saturday, April 25, 2015 2:58 PM|~|1987228947|~|1984511253|~|1

84545|~|Christian Wawrzonek '16|~|Hey Max, Reading your column honestly makes me wonder if you actually read mine, or simply read the title and skimmed for quotes to take out of context. First of all, much of what you argue actually agrees with my (and Steve's and Newby's) column. Your second paragraph is dedicated to highlighting issues where people were unnecessarily offended by what you refer to as "conservative political incorrectness." A fundamental point of my column was that offense is, by itself, not a justification to demand changes from others. I draw specific reference to religious right wing conservatives who take offense to gay rights and who make demands about what the gay community should and should not be allowed to do. This fits very well into your scheme of "conservative political correctness." However, I am very much against this justification, and I go on to say that without respectful, constructive discourse and sound logical defense for your offense, it is unreasonable for you to demand changes in the behavior of others. This applies to both conservatives attempting to curb socially liberal behavior as well as minorities demanding censorship of offensive and, as they claim, oppressive behavior. I failed to see the the extent of damage caused by Urban Congo, so I attempted to engage, which brings me to my next point. The structure of my column was centered around a discussion I attempted to have on Facebook. Despite your baseless claim that racial discussions for some reason make us white men uncomfortable, I am very comfortable having a discussion about any topic, race very much included, as long as the discussion maintains the principles of respect and reason. This is why Steve and I were the ones who sought out the individuals of the opposite opinion and took the initiative to engage with them. Presumably, this is the sort of behavior you would want, isn't it? Would you prefer that we remain close minded and shut ourselves into our own echo chamber, refusing to listen and engage with those of the opposing view? No. Now, the conversation on Facebook was of particular interest because of the intellectually shallow, racially biased, and self-entitled nature of the counterarguments I received. A major theme of the discussion was that I could not have an informed opinion regarding Urban Congo because of my race. Another theme was that the offending parties required no justification for their demands because of their race. I do not accept either of these as logically sound defenses for any position. As I said (and you said), I am not asking for sympathy. I don't need sympathy, because I'm not the one demanding that Urban Congo be disbanded and expelled. If you refuse to acknowledge the ability of minorities or marginalized groups to be perpetrators of racism, then you can never hope to sway the opinions of those who disagree with you because you will continue to dismiss and disregard their arguments and opinions. You call this "self pity and over-sensitivity." Yeah. Right. I don't see myself as a victim here. You and the minority community are the ones shouting cries of discrimination, yet are completely unwilling to defend yourself or give justification to those of us who fail to see how this is true, especially if we are white. Those who are offended and are demanding changes must be prepared to defend their positions. I did not write my column because I wanted sympathy as you claim. You said, "but he must have felt injured enough by a few Facebook comments to write a substance free column." I do not write columns to garner sympathy for myself. I write columns to express my opinion, point out logical inconsistency, and draw attention to issues I deem important. Again, for some reason unbeknownst to me, you seem to think my goal is to silence critics and suppress free speech, despite the fact that this is precisely the opposite thesis of my column. The purpose of my discussion on Facebook was to have an informed discussion. Of course, that doesn't even address Steve's column, who made his entire premise around not suppressing free speech. You point out the fact that we take issue with the open protest to the face of Eisgruber and use this as justification for our attempt to silence the opposing view. No Max, no. We take issue with this precisely because it is an attempt to end discussion and silence opposing views. The whole point of the chapel meeting was to have a discussion and address the issues that you and others had with Urban Congo. This attempt at discussion was met with contempt and dismissive protest. This is the enemy of free speech and discussion. I wanted to engage, and I wanted to have a discussion about the issue, but the offending parties refused. So therefore, I continue to disagree with their opinions (probably more so now) and nothing has changed. You have done nothing to help this issue as you did little more than insult me and claim that I'm being oversensitive. How ironic.|~|0|~|Friday, April 24, 2015 12:32 AM|~|1984502441|~|NA|~|1

84545|~|Reevaluate|~|To an extent, anyone who writes an opinion column is looking for sympathy. Sympathy for their opinion. Let's say that you enroll at a school where it's mostly girls as in maybe 20 to 1. You are noticeably different and already feel a bit of discomfort and isolation from the majority.  One day a girl in class makes a joke about kicking a guy in the nuts. Her friend answers back "oh yeah it doesn't actually hurt that bad, they just fake it for attention". The majority of the female students start to believe this narrative and begin to see kicking a dude in the nuts as a harmless joke. Now the guys are reasonably outraged, they speak out and try to get this practice to stop. But the girls get offended when the guys say "what would you know about balls if you don't have any?" and get dismissive when they try to debate whether kicking men in the nuts is a harmless joke or an offensive gesture. After all, the cause of pain should be enough but the girls keep insisting that they have freedom of movement as was guaranteed by their countries constitution. That is why a group of black students on campus are really agitated by students who are not black making arguments against them that basically go along the lines of "my freedom is more important than your pain". On top of that there is enormous academic stress and that constant theme of having to explain to an individual of a majority group why ___ is hurtful.  I wish you good luck as the year comes to a close. Take care and I hope this comment although a little short, helps you to reevaluate a few thoughts :) |~|1|~|Sunday, April 26, 2015 6:57 PM|~|1989054532|~|1984518691|~|0

Question to Uwe Reinhardt: would he like to proudly proclaim, "I invest in tear gas, which is used to suppress non-violent protests in Palestinian villages against the israeli occupation, and the non-violent protests against police brutality in Ferguson, and feel great!" The prof mistakes the means for the end. What does he think the occupation and oppression of Palestinian runs on, magical fairy dust? Going up to bat for the capitalists to say that there will always be ethically bankrupt investment entities to bankroll oppression? Yes, we recognize that the investments have been greatly immoral, and that's part of the reason why injustice continues — so we're educating people and gathering strength in numbers, because we don't like to live with privilege if that means killing and oppressing and killing, over and over, and over again.

With regards to the emptiness, you claim that the desired outcome you project on the movement--to significantly financially damage companies like Remax and HP--is not feasible given Princo's means. I'm not a core member of the movement so I guess I'm not entirely sure, but I don't believe anyone has ever claimed that as the goal. It seems to me that the goal is for the University to refuse to fund reprehensible activities, whether that funding be in the dozens or the billions of dollars. Which brings us to the morality. You claim that the statement is not worth making because students are not sacrificing enough. This argument seemed completely left-field to me. It would seem that the logical goal of any movement would be to do what one can to reach one's goals, regardless of the sacrifice required. You seem here to assert that the mandate should be to sacrifice and nothing more? This is absurd. The students wish to divest because it is what they are able to do with the platform available to them to oppose something morally reprehensible. That in itself is worth it. You seem to imply in your post that you will be engaging with replies, so I look forward to your doing so.|~|2|~|Tuesday, April 21, 2015 11:32 PM|~|1980617160|~|NA|~|0
84441|~|Uwe Reinhardt|~|Thank you for your comment, especially its civilized tone. I can appreciate that students are trying to build a movement with a strong message. I can also agree that the students' position should be respected in a serious debate. So the question is how best to deliver the message students wish to convery and whether just calling for disinvestment would fit the bill. Those calling for disinvestment could, for example, each chip in $100 and collectively purchase a full page ad in a major newspaper, featuring their signatures. Through social media students could organize a nationwide a gathering on the mall in DC to deliver their message. Students favoring disinvestment could pledge not to take a job on Wall Street, where they would inevitably directly or indirectly support with their work companies engaged in conduct of which the students disapprove. There are many more powerful media through which they could register their message. Of all these, calling for disinvestment is such an easy route and it is unlikely to be effective. That was my point in the column.|~|6|~|Tuesday, April 21, 2015 11:56 PM|~|1980672797|~|1980617160|~|0
84441|~|moss|~|The students are spending their time and making a great effort in order to spread the message and create an atmosphere of discussion. This alone should put it a step above "an empty gesture." You seem to argue that this is not enough. Their message is "empty" because they are not making enough personal sacrifice. That is completely ridiculous. How about we judge the message based on its contents, and not on the details of how it was delivered. The fact is, flagrant violations of human rights are occurring in Gaza and the West Bank. Even if divestment itself is not effective in harming the companies involved in this, the message sent is still clear: Princeton wants to have no role in these crimes. The movement itself has nothing to do with the content of the message. It could consist of a single person handing out flyers, or be a huge organization operating on a global level, but the underlying message would be the same. The legitimacy of the cause is not linked to how much money the students spend on it, or how widespread they are able to make it. And frankly, using your arguments, you could always say the movement could be bigger or more widespread and thus "an empty gesture." Of course in terms of economics, you are infinitely more qualified than me, so I'll take your word for it when you when you say that divestment probably won't make a difference to the companies, even though I have heard opposing views. But your biggest moral argument against divestment doesn't even criticize divestment itself, but rather the students organizing the movement.|~|1|~|Friday, April 24, 2015 12:21 AM|~|1984494792|~|1980672797|~|0

I was not addressing your message. I argued that the medium you chose to deliver that message amounted to an empty gesture. Years ago Marshall MacLuhan offered the thesis that "the medium is the message." The idea is that given message has a different impact depending upon how it is delivered. In one of my responses to an earlier comment I listed a number of different ways in which students could deliver their message. Of these possibilities, disinvestment strikes me as the weakest one and, perhaps coincidentally, one that minimizes the costs born by the students seeking to deliver the message.|~|0|~|Friday, April 24, 2015 10:19 AM|~|1985088662|~|1984494792|~|0

I'm not a core member of the movement so I guess I'm not entirely sure, but I don't believe anyone has ever claimed that as the goal." Actually, this is the stated goal of the divestment campaign, see this paragraph from the divestment campaign's website: "This divestment campaign aims to discourage companies from contributing to human rights violations and to undermine the occupation’s material means of support. The goal of divestment is not only to cause a downward spiral of decreasing stock value that makes future investment risky, but also to compel these companies to review and change the practices for which they are being targeted." ( http://www.princetondivests.or... Opposition to morally reprehensible activity doesn't really seem to be mentioned on that page, the motive is actually that "in few other cases do Americans and American institutions have such leverage to enact positive changes on the ground". But if we are going to make a case for divestment based only on moral reprehensibility and not outcomes, then why start with Israel? Israel is clearly not the world's worst human rights abuser, wouldn't it make more sense to start with the US, which enables Israel's human rights abuses and is responsible for many more through other means.|~|4|~|Wednesday, April 22, 2015 1:42 AM|~|1980772710|~|1980617160|~|0

International pressure is the only tool that can be applied on Israel to offer concessions, at a time when a whole suite of pressures are being applied to the Palestinians daily. So the economic analysis is irrelevant at best. And the many attempts by the daily Princetonian, including its editorial, in the last few days to sway the vote are questionable.

How are you going to achieve that international pressure? Well, you want to discourage companies from contributing to these human rights violations. You think that if people stop investing in them, that puts pressure on them to stop doing the act that you think is bad. But you also say that divestment is not about hurting companies. So if the companies are not hurt, why would they change their practices? This whole thing is an economic analysis. The only question is if divestment can bring about international pressure. Based on your logic - that divestment is not about hurting these companies - then divestment itself serves no purpose. Why not send an open letter to the NYT condemning these companies' practices? Why not send a highly publicized petition to Congress to sanction Israel?

84441|~|Sarah Sakha|~|“One can also debate whether it is reasonable to force upon the University community a general policy on which that community is as sharply divided as it is on this issue.” Interesting choice of words. How exactly would such a policy be forced upon the University community? It is being voted on, in a student-led referendum, for a reason. And only then in a bilateral effort with the University could it be implemented. Furthermore, your pointing out the lack of a consensus implies that as a warrant for not implementing such a policy. I would appreciate it if you could point out one issue in the history of national and/or international politics where there has been a 100% consensus on an issue. Where there is debate, where there is conflict, there is inevitably, and sadly, division, but that is no reason for why such a policy should be discredited. “Should PRINCO divest from any company that does business with countries that by our standards violate human rights — for example, say, those of women? Should PRINCO dump the stocks of the manufacturers of drones or guns?” I’m sure if the question at hand where hypothetically whether PRINCO should divest from any company that does business with Iran/deals with Iran’s nuclear program, we wouldn’t hesitate to divest. But even more importantly, economics involves a conversation of ethics, and our decision to invest in certain companies is a reflection of where our ethics lie. Plus, private institutions choose where to divest from all the time based on certain moral and ethical considerations – not saying I support it, but my [Catholic] high school chose not to send its money to any cause/organization that supported Planned Parenthood. “I also judge it a facile gesture. Moral statements have more force, more personal sacrifice behind them, thanks to their advocates. What sacrifice do the advocates of disinvestment actually personally bear for that advocacy? I am hard put to think of any. Even if the policy were to impose a permanent loss on PRINCO, that is, on the University at large, who actually would bear these economic consequences?” Let me ask you this: what is the personal sacrifice that the people under the Israeli occupation of Gaza must bear? Why don’t we consider that sacrifice that comes as a cost of our investing in these companies? The question should not be of the magnitude of PRINCO’s sacrifice – it should be of the magnitude of the profit PRINCO makes from the status quo, should it not? With all due respect, while I am a proponent of civility and respect in discourse and debate, calling such a policy "facile" and "morally empty" defies such principles.|~|2|~|Wednesday, April 22, 2015 12:45 AM|~|1980731412|~|NA|~|1

I am not aware that disinvestment was a major weapon in the arsenal of Gandhi or MLK. They used more direct measures, at great personal risk.  If students want to practice passive resistance, let them openly sign a pledge never to take a job in a company that directly or indirection supports an activity to which they object on moral grounds. I would imagine that this would preclude taking a job on Wall Street. That would be effective passive resistance, and it would be noted in the media.|~|0|~|Friday, April 24, 2015 10:30 AM|~|1985106499|~|1984206889|~|0

84441|~|Uwe Reinhardt|~|The article on Sodastream you cite opens up with: "Israeli drinks company Sodastream is to move a factory out of the West Bank amid calls from Palestinian activists for a boycott. Boycotts are not to be confused with disinvestment.  Usually a "boycott" means a refusal to buy the company's products. It would directly affect the top line of the company's income statement, and thus its earnings per share. As I noted in my column, such tactics would hurt a company and might persuade it to desist from activities loathed by the boycotters. By the way, upon reading the entire article I wonder whether the close to 1,000 Palestinians and Arab Israeli's employed by Sodastream's West Bank factory would have voted for the boycott. It is possible that G4S chose not to renew its contract with the Israeli government because The Gates Foundation divested itself of G4S stock. On the other hand, you probably know that G4S had become something of a basket case quite aside from that contract, that the previous CEO was dismissed and a new one was brought in to clean up the mess. As the article you cite points out "The reasons for G4S not renewing the controversial contracts remain unknown."|~|0|~|Friday, April 24, 2015 10:43 AM|~|1985127555|~|1982527026|~|0

G4S has been a much loathed private security contractor engaged in violent attacks and the deaths of many denizens around the world. It has been met with protests wherever they go, whenever they hold shareholder meetings. This is what movement looks like, common grievances empowering one another to build critical mass. If there wasn't such vocal widespread protest against G4S, and public shaming of Gates Foundation for investing in G4S —antithetical to Gates Foundation's mission— highly unlikely that it would have unloaded its 170 M investment.|~|0|~|Monday, April 27, 2015 7:29 AM|~|1989667446|~|1985127555|~|1

When you leave this bubble of comfort you have erected to protect your fragile psyche from any unpleasantness, you will realize most people (especially low income minorities just trying to go about their business) are too busy having real problems to waste time on such petty bs.  Seriously how bored are you?  It's going to be very difficult maintaining this precious cocoon of outrage once you leave Princeton.|~|2|~|Monday, April 20, 2015 10:36 PM|~|1978615312|~|NA|~|0
84279|~|Christian Wawrzonek '16|~|"Blackandtiredofthebs," your comment was unconvincing. Two things to say about this. 1) I fail to see how the existence of other problems negates the importance or severity of this issue. Now, I can only assume that you are referring to income inequality or racial discrimination, but I can't know for sure as you failed to elaborate. I recognize that both of these are serious problems that need to be addressed, but I consider misogyny to be equally important. The fact that the low income minority community faces much adversity in their lives does not afford them the intellectual ground to create equally serious problems in the lives of others. (To clarify, I'm not saying that low income minorities are solely responsible for the perpetuation of gender discrimination, I'm simply responding to your attempt to give them an intellectual pass because of the "real problems" they face). In addition, if you so callously dismiss the importance of this issue, you can not justifiably ask for sympathy for your problems either when you clearly have none to give. 2) I agree with you, Princeton is an absurdly welcoming place for just about any politically correct issue when compared to the outside world, but this is by no means justification for stalling activism or becoming complacent with the culture we live in. Would it be fair for me to say that you should stop "whining" about racism because Princeton students are leaps and bounds less racist than the world at large, especially the rural south? Certainly not. Princeton is still not perfect, and we as students should (respectfully and peacefully) have open discussions about every issue that we see as important to bettering the world. In addition, if you or any other student is unhappy with the general culture or prevailing opinions of students on this campus, it is very much appropriate to try to change this. Princeton students are undoubtedly the future leaders of the world, and their opinions will arguably have a significant effect on our world of tomorrow.|~|3|~|Tuesday, April 21, 2015 9:15 AM|~|1979172857|~|1978615312|~|1

Show me an artist who has never offended anyone, whom nobody considers "problematic," and I will show you an artist who has just offended me for being unbelievably dull. The art that a person likes or even produces does not necessarily reflect on that person's moral character - look no further than the legions of horror movie directors who have never dismembered anyone.

Steel Panther is a parody band - although the fact that they use the same sexist imagery to make their point is still problematic. And Marilyn Manson? He's a sh*t disturber but there's not a whole lot in his music that could be characterized as misogynistic. I went to a Black Sabbath concert a year ago with my brother and had to stand beside him for over an hour, uncomfortably, having no choice but to watch naked women, whose presence served no practical purpose whatsoever except to reinforce the message that metal is for heterosexual men. Do you think I just shrugged my shoulders, or do you think I might have had something to say about that? See, this is why guys should STFU and listen for a change. Who do you think is in a better position to understand the implications of hateful language directed at women? People who experience it every day or people whose privilege protects them from ever having to experience it? The strangest part about reading these inane comments is trying to figure out whether mansplainers are being deliberately ignorant or actually believe their own propaganda. Guess what? Women - and feminists especially - like subversion. We're actually human beings capable of critical thought, did you know that? Going against the grain is something we know very well because that's what it means to live in a world where men can talk about abusing and hating women openly, and when women dare to question it there's no shortage of dude bros telling us how we should feel. You can GTFO with that. Feminists have always criticized Elvis, G N' R, and 50 Cent, in addition to many other acts across every genre and from every social group imaginable. The reason you don't know it is because every time we try to talk about it, we get shut down.

Anyone who studied apartheid in South Africa should easily see that Israel bears no resemblance to South Africa. Israeli citizens vote, hold any public office (an Arab even sits on the Supreme Court), enter any profession, use the same facilities and hospitals.  The Israeli Constitution guarantees everyone the same rights. South Africa's laws specifically denied equal rights to Blacks. Perhaps Tutu should visit Israel. For all we know, his knowledge of Israel is based on the propaganda he reads on his computer. If you want to act against anti-Palestinian apartheid in the Middle East, start with the fact that every Arab country except Jordan denies Palestinians citizenship. They cannot enter certain professions. Their land ownership is widely restricted. They cannot hold public office, even if they have lived in those Arab countries for generations. Palestinians may not complain so much publicly about this, because it is not politically or financially expedient for them to do so. But they will privately admit that they hate how they are treated by their brother Arabs.|~|2|~|Monday, April 20, 2015 8:10 AM|~|1977263922|~|1976610217|~|1

I'd agree if we were writing checks for an evil despot that would be political. This level of remove really makes me scratch my head. If you want to say that, definitionally speaking, all investments (regardless of vehicle, level of involvement or profit, complexity of moral situation, etc.) are political, then go ahead. But that's your own deontology, not some obvious moral truth. And while it is arguably true on some philosophical plane (again, I'm inclined to disagree here), there's no question that divestment is far more political in terms of the statements being HEARD. I think that probably also implies that the political meaning of divestment is far more significant than non-divestment. When we invested in a fund that may or may not have been invested in these stocks we were almost certainly not thinking about the political dimensions of that, and could not have expected that others would understand our investment as such. That's not the case here. So whether it is equally "political" on some Platonic meaning of the word is a debate we can have, but I think it's clear that the conventional political meaning of divestment is of a different quality entirely than the initial investments.|~|0|~|Sunday, April 19, 2015 10:26 PM|~|1976694262|~|1976663485|~|0

The idea that we profit off of the occupation is a pretty far-fetched one, mainly optical (i.e. of symbolic value). There are a ton of bad things in the world, and enough companies and individuals and governments that are related such that you can find yourself somewhere in the complex interlocking web. That is a pretty damn low bar for a stance. Divesting, however, is an active, symbolic political statement.

84128|~|Christian Wawrzonek '16|~|Hey Caroline. Thank you for your words. Your column was well written, but unconvincing. Let me first say that I have not yet made up my mind regarding this issue, but unfortunately your article did not persuade me and let me explain why. You continually assert that the issue of divestment is highly complex and not dichotomous, but I failed to see any evidence to suggest any nuance within the issue, other than it creates "false dichotomies." The only point you make on that front is that this equates to ending negotiations with Israel and fully supporting Palestine, which I don't agree with. A few things to say to this. It is possible to disagree with decisions made by Israel without immediately resorting to full abandonment of their cause. In fact, one could argue that you yourself are making false dichotomies by stating that divestment equates to full desertion of Israel. I'll be honest, I don't have a thorough understanding of the economic impact this will have on the military occupation, but to me this is irrelevant. Regardless of impact, this is a statement of principle, namely an open censure of the unbridled use of military force. I don't know if there exists a clear answer to the debate over this contested land, but I know that violence is never the answer. You cite Tigers Together as another group attempting to create open dialogue between the two sides and how this somehow should negate our support or opposition of divestment. This is a logical fallacy, in that others are attempting to accomplish the same goal says nothing about he legitimacy of this issue. Perhaps the best solution is both movements working together. Perhaps these movements are in contention and they should not exist together, but if that was your argument, it was not clear. A minor point, but something else I took issue with. You attempt to generate sympathy for Israel by defending their actions during Operation Protective Edge, particularly with respect to their bombing of UN schools during summer 2014. Your column is about divestment and the many (still unknown to me) facets of the issue, so this feels like an unnecessary tangent attempting to justify Israel's actions. In addition, this is probably not the best topic to cover when defending Israel. Again, as somebody who has little preference for who controls what land or who has right to what, I fundamentally do not support the killing of innocent people, especially not children. Yes, Hamas uses children and civilians as shields to defend their heinous actions, but they do so precisely because these people should not be killed, especially not to eliminate rocket supplies.|~|2|~|Monday, April 20, 2015 2:48 AM|~|1976906043|~|NA|~|1
84128|~|M D|~|The article was not terribly convincing, but divestment is still the wrong decision. Here's why: If you are proposing divestment, you obviously have a goal in mind. What is that goal? You can't just pressure Israel to end the occupation -- you have to give it another option. It won the land and occupation is the only option until a two-state solution is reached. If a two-state solution is the way to end the occupation, you are just reinforcing the intransigence of the PA by showing it it can rely on college activists to put pressure on Israel. It will think it can bypass talking to Israel and instead just use misguided (but well-intentioned) people in the West. The current Israeli government is not helpful, but it is a symptom -- not the problem. The Israeli people voted in two leftist governments (rabin and olmert) that tried to make peace but were flatly rebuffed. Thus, what can you accomplish by economically hurting Israel? It has demonstrated its willingness to make concessions -- all that's left is a Palestinian partner willing to relinquish the right of return and all of East Jerusalem.|~|1|~|Monday, April 20, 2015 12:17 PM|~|1977642733|~|1976906043|~|1

Now, before I write the following, I want to point out that these are not my opinions, but the conclusions of a rigorous fact-finding team -- Contrary to the relentless talking points from the IDF, Hamas has not used children and civilians as human shields. In a 2009 Amnesty International report, "Amnesty International, for its part, did not find evidence that Hamas or other Palestinian groups violated the laws of war to the extent repeatedly alleged by Israel. In particular, it found no evidence that Hamas or other fighters directed the movement of civilians to shield military objectives from attacks.”  Undeterred, the Israeli military decided to repeat its claims that Hamas used human shields, and had barred Amnesty International from entering Gaza following Operation PE this past summer. On the other hand, Defence of Children International found that Israeli soldiers had forced Palestinians to become human shields when they entered the Gaza Strip (link follows): http://972mag.com/palestinian-...|~|1|~|Monday, April 20, 2015 4:47 PM|~|1978145435|~|1976906043|~|1

83983|~|Steve Swanson '15|~|Columns about Urban Congo and the surrounding fallout, to which I assume this a reference, were authored by: Zeena Mubarak, Nicholas Wu, Ryan Dukeman, Newby Parton, Kovey Coles, Sarah Sakha, Christian Wawrzonek, the Editorial Board, and me, Steve Swanson. How legitimate is the characterization of a Prince columnist itching to show the "white male perspective" given that just half of the columns about this issue were in that category? Slight over representation relative to proportion of the student body aside, that's a total of 4 white male columnists (assuming the race of my fellow writers based on their names, that is). I think this is a funny cartoon, especially the graph part, but I don't think it's a legitimate criticism to say the Prince panders to only one demographic. |~|2|~|Friday, April 17, 2015 6:11 AM|~|1972268414|~|NA|~|1
83983|~|Jack Moore '15|~|1) it's a joke 2) I wasn't trying to say that the Prince "panders to only one demographic" but rather saying even though authors acknowledge that issues have been beaten to death in this paper, they still write the same columns and try to justify their (uninteresting) perspectives 3) to me, as a white male, half of the columnists being white men IS a lot. Society hears from us all the time. We don't need half of the Prince being devoted to that same view.  4) you kinda proved my point by feeling the need to defend yourself in a comic 5) it's a joke|~|0|~|Friday, April 17, 2015 1:23 PM|~|1972902010|~|1972268414|~|0
83983|~|Steve Swanson '15|~|Thanks for responding, Jack. While I understand that this is an editorial cartoon, and hence a joke, that doesn't mean that it doesn't make some kind of point. If I make a joke about what a terrible cartoonist you are, I'm still calling you a terrible cartoonist, humor or no. Obviously your particular joke is underlain by the perception that too many white men wrote about this issue, as evidenced by your response. That aside, I strongly reject the idea that columnists should have stopped writing on the issue because they (we) are white men. If you find the perspectives uninteresting, that's a perfectly valid opinion to have, but one far removed from the race and gender of the columnists. Complaining that the Prince beats subjects to death is legitimate. People tend to write on hot button issues simultaneously and glut these topics for a week or more. That's why the top part of your cartoon is funny, biting, and accurate. But your assertion that "half the Prince" is devoted to the white male view is wrongheaded. Treating white people as a monolith is simply incorrect, as is the case with any racial group. Ryan Dukeman argues that dismissing other's claims of racism is illiberal while Christian Wawrzonek thinks that asking others to "educate themselves" is intellectually dishonest; Newby Parton takes an uncompromising stand on absolute free speech whereas I approach it as the lesser of two evils. These columns bear some similarity, sure, but they are certainly not the same perspective expressed over and over. The Prince published 4 columns on similar topics by white male authors because this many white males submitted columns, not because it's devoted to their perspective. If more racially diverse students had written columns, all of here would have been published as well. At the end of the day, do you think we should not weigh in on topics because of our racial and gender identities? Sure, "society hears from" white males all the time. But not all white males think the same and silencing people based on the color of the skin and their chromosomes rarely works out well.|~|3|~|Friday, April 17, 2015 1:53 PM|~|1972956774|~|1972902010|~|1

83983|~|Christian Wawrzonek '16|~|1) I find it ironic that you begin (and end) by asserting that this was a joke as if to circumvent any sort of disagreement with the point you were trying to make. As Steve pointed out, you very clearly have a point. And despite your attempts to appear apathetic by stating it was a joke, you are clearly very opinionated on the issue, seeing as you followed this with a series of clarifications and counterarguments. Don't get me wrong, having opinions is absolutely acceptable (I'm obviously very opinionated) and I'd happily engage your opinions. However, don't try to avoid criticism by pretending that it was simply just "a joke." 2) Sure, the paper has a problem with repetitive coverage of issues. That's a legitimate criticism that the editorial board is trying to address, but is also kind of expected given the high volume of columns and high profile nature of the Urban Congo debacle. However, as Steve said, I think each column done by us "white men" said something very different about the issue and each is worth a read. Calling them uninteresting, well that's your opinion. 3) I doubt that I need to remind you of this, but half of the columnists being white is a proportional representation of the white population on campus. The paper is not seeking out this demographic, nor are they being over represented. White students have opinions just like minority students. And again, painting all white males as "having the same view" is, well ironically racist, as I mentioned in my "uninteresting" column that you most likely skipped over because I'm a white male. On the flip side, perhaps the Prince should not be devoting half of its coverage to minority viewpoints, which by your logic, "all have the same view." 4) By defending ourselves, we are proving your point? That is as striking of a logical fallacy as they come. I suppose your argument is infallible then, because anybody who attempts to dissent is simply proving your point. How convenient. Again, an issue I covered in my "uninteresting" column. And what exactly is your point? That the white male perspective is over represented? Well then I suppose we should just stop caring about opinions that come from us white males then because... we are white? Again, as Steve pointed out, you don't want to justify your platform with racism. 5) Yeah, you said that already.|~|0|~|Friday, April 17, 2015 10:01 PM|~|1973677224|~|1972902010|~|1

Second, what country in the world would accept illegal tunnels as a  norm?  Over 1,700 tunnels have been discovered. Recommend the author read the latest Gatestone institute, praising the approach in Sinai because it is effective and it is working on stopping the flow of weapons to terrorists. Third, Hamas  who controls the Gaza strip is a recognized terrorist organization, the very roots of which lie in the Muslim Brotherhood.  This some how makes them a legitimate government?  Irony, that the author uses the term coup for Egypt but doesn't acknowledge that is exactly what happens in Gaza with Hamas. The onus for the problem in Gaza lies squarely on Hamas.

83981|~|nah|~|it's actually pretty clear. another way of putting it is: in order for divestment to be a moral obligation, you need to show that investment is doing harm and divestment will help mitigate that harm. if you haven't shown both of those things, you haven't shown it to be a moral obligation. this definitely assumes that moral obligations are only incurred insofar as they have some literal impact--something of a utilitarian argument. but when it comes to activism, it seems pretty relevant to show that there is in fact good (could be reduction of harm) done by some sort of action. without that, i would argue that social activism becomes (intentionally or not) more about one's ego and personal commitments and less about the people you're supposedly trying to help.|~|0|~|Friday, April 17, 2015 12:36 AM|~|1972009246|~|1971910644|~|0

There is real value in engaging with those who have differing opinions. Perhaps I'm missing something about the argument, or perhaps I'm unfairly biased in my information gathering. The most important reason is of course that others have different perspectives, which is especially true in racial issues. Do not assume that just because I have attempted to engage means that I did not do any of my own research. In addition, I apologize if I did not make this clear, but I am not claiming that every person who disagrees with Urban Congo is stubborn and close minded. Instead, I'm simply observing that this is obviously an emotionally charged issues, and a significant portion of the offended parties have used the same logical fallacies and racially dismissive tones. When attempting to engage the most vocal critics against Urban Congo, this was an all too common and frustrating theme.|~|0|~|Friday, April 17, 2015 10:31 PM|~|1973708785|~|1972017581|~|1

83828|~|Steve Swanson '15|~|Thanks for the clarification. Referring to the restriction of hate speech in the various states of Europe as a "European theory of free speech" was a shorthand, certainly not meant to imply that Europe is a monolithic bloc with identical laws. Perhaps it would have been better if I'd used a supranational body's attitudes on free speech, rather than Denmark's, as a representative of a broader European view. The view of the European Court of Human Rights, summarized here  http://www.echr.coe.int/Docume...  , certainly does fall in line with what I described as the European theory ("it may be considered necessary in certain democratic societies to sanction or even prevent all forms of expression which spread, incite, promote or justify hatred  based on intolerance,"), but obviously the opinions of the supranational court don't necessarily represent those of all its constituent nations and people. Apologies if you felt that my characterization was overly broad -- space did not allow for a detailed explanation of the variety of speech laws throughout Europe.|~|0|~|Thursday, April 16, 2015 2:01 PM|~|1971105085|~|1971065566|~|1

83828|~|there's more to it|~|Cute but very under thought. We can even ignore historical influences on racism to make this point. So you have group A, this group A is large enough that most marketing, cultural items, etc are made to appeal to them. They are also a much larger group in a given area. They make a statement about group B -a much smaller group that group B happens to find offending. Due to the sheer size of A, A lives in an echo chamber of ideas. So when B makes a complaint to A, every other member of the A group has a "feeling" that something is wrong with B's complaint not because of B's argument being wrong but instead on response to echo chamber conditioning. They conflate this conditioning with some kind of logical intuition when in reality it's a question of perspective and power. They then make arguments against B's feelings which literally outnumber the arguments from B's perspectives. Add in elements of historical oppression, underdeveloped minds and personalities (we're all still young students) and you get a real crap show for group B. The thing that really gets me is that there is very little real attempt at empathy from a large chunk of campus for black students. It's actually increasingly depressing and shows a huge lack of basic humanity. Even if you see Urban Congo as a small event, no one is asking "what happens on a day to day basis that THIS is what sets it off". |~|0|~|Sunday, April 19, 2015 8:28 AM|~|1975595779|~|1972573412|~|0
83828|~|Steve Swanson '15|~|This comment doesn't explicitly disagree with my column at all. You're expressing that speech can be deeply harmful, especially to groups that don't have numeric superiority, which is a point with which I certainly agree -- I say that speech can cause "deep psychological damage and perpetuat[e] negative stereotypes." Implicit in your comment, though (since you accuse my viewpoint of being "under thought") is the idea that "because speech can be so harmful to minority groups, it ought to be regulated." But you haven't answered any of my reasons against hate speech legislation in the original column, instead opting to expand on the harmful effects that we agree can result from totally free speech. If you'd like to say that this damage is so great as to overbalance the reasons against campus speech codes, you should make that explicit. I'll point that the Urban Congo case would seem to refute your "groups A and B" model -- the performance may have only been harmful to group B, but with no intervention by the university, the group disbanded and formally apologized. What outcome would you have preferred?|~|1|~|Sunday, April 19, 2015 2:30 PM|~|1976096488|~|1975595779|~|1

83832|~|hmm|~|I guess what I'm saying is it's only ironic if you abstract away everything he is saying and only treat it on a vague level. That is a good approach if you're looking for a pithy rhetorical reply, but not if you want to respond to the points he's actually making. If he said "ugh I hate complainers" it would be a little bit ironic (still not so ironic ... one instance of complaining does not make someone a complainer, and it seems reasonable to oppose the latter but not the former). But he seems to be saying that this is unjustified complaining--that the reactions are too intense, either because the underlying offenses are objectively not so serious, or that they might warrant some form of a response but not one as widespread and confrontational as they allegedly have received. There have been emails sent out to listserves, petitions, postings to public forums, and a lot of other activity. His post, on the other hand, is a post on his own profile page, which is presumably not as directly confrontational of a medium. So in addition to possibly being correct in the underlying substantive claim about the justifiedness of the others' complaints, the magnitude of his own complaint might not rise to the level that would trigger his annoyance (were it coming from another party). This all leads me to conclude that there isn't any inconsistency or real irony here.|~|0|~|Thursday, April 16, 2015 5:10 PM|~|1971462064|~|1971094927|~|0

I think you misread the article, or perhaps could not follow the reasoning, if your takeaway is still that these issues are black and white. As I said, facts can be right or wrong (ideally along that binary) but morality is perceived differently by different people and, in fact, you learn morality by how it affects others (i.e. immoral acts like lying, stealing, etc hurt others). The question becomes: are you moral enough to avoid something that hurts some, but not all, people? Additionally, what scares you about people who get upset about things that offend them, or things that are untrue. It would seem that the alternative is much more troubling.|~|0|~|Thursday, April 16, 2015 3:02 PM|~|1971227077|~|1970196095|~|0
83832|~|hmm|~|So you say you don't think it's a black and white issue (which I would imagine you think), but your explanation of the morality involved seems to kind of paint it that way ... There's always going to be a range of reactions to a given act. I'd agree you're an asshole (possibly engaged in an immoral act, though that gets weighty and philosophical) if you do something that you know will hurt other people, assuming there aren't good reasons to counter-balance that. It gets a little fuzzier when you get into the realm of acts you don't know will hurt other people, but arguably should have known. Where do we draw the line of "should"? (Personally I think UC fails this test ... seems pretty wack).  There's a separate question, though, of that balance between hurting people and the countervailing payoff. If someone's sense of propriety is really deeply ingrained by me jay-walking to save someone's life, I'd imagine that I shouldn't really care about what they think. Things get fuzzier as you move along that spectrum on both sides. What sorts of freedoms to expression or activity are we willing to limit (and in so doing make programmatic rules about how people can go about enjoying themselves, getting pleasure out of life, etc.) to prevent others from potentially being hurt? How do we think about the nature of that pain, anyway? Is taking offense a lot of pain or a little pain (or whatever you want to call this ... negative utility maybe)? How do micro-offenses play into a larger narrative of offense which collectively has a major impact on people? How major? I think in some sense rambling on in this way and raising all the questions overcomplicates some specific issues (but is still important). I'm comfortable saying that UC offends a lot of people, and it shouldn't happen, and we should live in a society where people are considerate enough to realize that this might play that way and act accordingly. But I do think that this leaves room to critique the magnitude of the reaction, which should presumably be related to the level of blameworthiness of the act (itself a function of how intensely problematic it was, how much we can expect the actors realized/should have realized this, etc.) as well as (from a utilitarian perspective, at least), the efficacy of such a reaction, which has to do with the complicated question of how social change happens in communities of different stripes. Maybe one positive outcome of this shitshow is that the Facebook post, the tweets, and all of the reactions, will one day (perhaps once this broader episode ends, hopefully well) be able to serve as interesting fodder for analysis of that question.|~|0|~|Thursday, April 16, 2015 5:32 PM|~|1971497364|~|1971227077|~|0

83832|~|Steve Swanson '15|~|Great guest column, Kovey. A caveat, though: by having a title including "a case for political correctness" and disagreeing with Julius in the first paragraph, you're probably going to get (and already seem to have gotten) a lot of comments from people who didn't read the whole thing but disagree with what they assume your point is. I couldn't agree more with your reasoning about discourse: it ought to be open, compassionate, and factually correct, with these principles each enforced by members of the community. It's frustrating that our columns were laid out the way they were in the paper this morning, making it look like we took two different sides of this issue, when, "you can say or do whatever you want, but expect swift redress when your comments are... morally wrong" is exactly my own column's point. As a side note, I think that using "political correctness" to describe the kind of self-policing you discuss doesn't really do your point justice. "Politically correct" is a pretty slimy phrase if you think about it -- the implication is that certain types of speech should be self-censored for "political" reasons, not because of compassion or desire for literal correctness. Your reasoning in favor of speech being less offensive is much more nuanced than simple self-interested politicking, so I think characterizing this column as a "case for political correctness" sells it short.|~|0|~|Thursday, April 16, 2015 11:47 AM|~|1970844824|~|NA|~|1

That said, Dixon's post is just one of many examples of hard-headed students ignorantly talking past each other with no attempt to understand. Like Urban Congo, that doesn't mean it should be censored (I'm pretty uncomfortable with the fact he felt obligated to remove it), but that does mean it was wrong. |~|0|~|Thursday, April 16, 2015 4:00 AM|~|1970269823|~|NA|~|0
83832|~|Anonymous|~|The inflamatory post by Julius Dixon is here in full: Butthurt Princeton students - stop. This morning I woke up to emails on emails, and posts on posts about why people were “offended” by various things that they’d seen recently. Dudes running around and making weird noises is now apparently “cultural misappropriation.” I read from one girl that it “literally ruined [her] day.” A guy today says that Urban Congo is the “bastardization of African culture.” Every day there’s another op-ed throwing around buzzwords like these. Are these the legitimate concerns of people at this school? smh Other kids are talking about “boycotting” Big Sean at lawn parties because apparently his lyrics are too offensive for their sensitive dispositions. Know that if you don’t attend the event, the proportion of fun people in the crowd will necessarily increase. Please, stay home. The wildest thing I saw came this morning. One guy gets offended by one stupid thing, and another girl gets heated that he was offended by the wrong thing. Apparently, he was supposed to have been offended by all the other random things that had all offended her individuality in one way or another. Wow. We walk around on egg shells in this place trying not to say the wrong thing because all the butthurt narcissists around us can’t deal with opinions that don’t fit their tastefully created world views. To the PC police and all other butthurt parties - the rest of the world is not here to cater to you. Nobody cares that you can’t deal with your own life. Don’t try to dictate how others should live theirs. |~|0|~|Thursday, April 16, 2015 12:28 AM|~|1970100985|~|NA|~|0

83548|~|'15|~|As a white person, I am so sick of hearing other white people pretend like this is an issue that can be hashed out according to some bizarre system of logic, which depends solely on so-called "facts." It is not about dictionary definitions, or where a river is, it's about how racism -- by virtue of what it is -- doesn't effect us in the same way that it effects black people. Your own article shows this to be true. Urban Congo didn't offend you, and therefore you don't feel it's offensive. You pretend at some form of logical argument, but that is the gist of it: it didn't piss you off, and therefore it cannot be what people are saying it is. It is your lack of feelings here that makes you think you have the right to dismiss this issue (which you do not) just as you think it is others' feelings that make this issue invalid. This is as illogical as you thinking that your "valid" response to Urban Congo can even approximate what it means to someone who accurately perceives it as an exercise of white supremacist cultural erasure and insult and disrespect. Because we live in a racist culture, and because racism works for us, it's obviously much harder for us to notice it when it's happening: it's supposed to slip past us unnoticed, BECAUSE we are white. Think again of how you felt when someone made fun of how you said "wh," and how you wrote a whole article about how that experience opened your mind and heart, with more thought and care than you clearly put into this one. Frankly, it is shameful, and I hope you're ashamed -- I am of you, and of all of us on this campus who reveal exactly how well racism works for us at moments like this, and how complicit we are in making sure it stays that way.|~|5|~|Tuesday, April 14, 2015 9:33 AM|~|1966770924|~|NA|~|0

The point of my column is to say that demanding censorship harms discussion and important freedoms. It's fine that people took offense. It's not fine that they want to force silence on groups they object to. Let me give an example. I am an ally to the gay community, so I take offense to the Anscombe society.

83548|~|William Rivitz|~|That's the thing - I think that what Newby is arguing is that he really has no idea why this is so offensive, specifically because the "calls for censorship," as he puts it, mean that he hasn't actually heard anyone explain it. As he says, "I may not understand why you took offense, but I understand that you did, and I recognize that those feelings are valid. I have offered my perception of the group not to denounce you, but to show that other valid feelings exist also. Ideally, we would have resolved our different feelings with constructive dialogue. What is cultural appropriation, and why is it bad? What is art, and when is it good to blend cultures and caricatures? We did not determine the answer to these questions, and if our calls for censorship are heard, we will never be able to do so." When he's calling for "constructive dialogue," I may be wrong, of course, but I don't think he's calling for blatantly ignoring the racist culture in which we all exist. I think he's calling for people to explain, in no uncertain terms, how what happened here plays into the racist culture at hand.|~|0|~|Tuesday, April 14, 2015 10:12 AM|~|1966830030|~|1966770924|~|1

83548|~|Newby Parton|~|I should note that I am not on social media, so if people explained the problem well on Facebook, I did not see it. Will was correct to affirm that I understand the validity of others' feelings even if I cannot empathize with them. I hope this is a two-way street. I sincerely believe that the accusations of racism are unfounded. Racism has two definitions, according to Merriam-Webster. First, it is "a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race." Urban Congo was drumming on wet floor signs, not asserting superiority over blacks. Second, racism is "racial prejudice or discrimination." Again here, Urban Congo did not discriminate against blacks. Students of all races could see their performance and for the same price. Your earlier comparison to my "wh" column is fair, but I will say that in that case, people actively poked fun at an individual's speech -- mine. If Urban Congo poked fun at speakers of African American Vernacular English, with the implication that Standard English is superior, then fine, that's racism. What happened instead was that men wore loincloths and made percussion music. To iterate, I am not saying that people are misguided to take offense at Urban Congo. I am saying that a call to censor any club encroaches on freedom of speech and expression, and that harms us far more than it helps us.|~|2|~|Tuesday, April 14, 2015 11:21 AM|~|1966944692|~|1966834025|~|1

83548|~|William Rivitz|~|I've seen that too, which is why I'm a little unsure where he's coming from here, but I think it's also worth considering that (specifically talking about social media for a moment) a lot of students aren't exposed to a lot of the stuff going around on social media because they're not friends with the right people. Prince columns from last week notwithstanding, two of the most prevalent sentiments I've heard from my friends are something along the lines of "Why does this matter so much?" and "I don't think the way students are going about protesting Urban Congo is a good idea." This isn't to say those sentiments are right, per se, but rather to say those sentiments do in fact exist on a large scale on campus. Newby would fall into that (surprisingly large) group, and, much like the other students, may have needed someone to point him in the right direction but found no one.|~|1|~|Tuesday, April 14, 2015 10:27 AM|~|1966858360|~|1966834025|~|1
83548|~|Nicholas Wu|~|Newby, I'd like to clarify what I said in my column. Groups are free to say whatever they want - it's just a matter of receiving funding and recognition from the University, a matter in which the University can exercise its own discretion over who receives money. I very much believe in the right to free expression, including offensive speech. Conversely, the right to free expression also grants people the right to criticize other speech that they find objectionable or outright offensive. Urban Congo could perform a "show." People can then strongly critique the show for the offensive sham that it was. And that's all protected under the 1st Amendment. |~|2|~|Monday, April 13, 2015 9:36 PM|~|1966077154|~|NA|~|1
83548|~|Newby Parton|~|Hey Nicholas, thanks for posting. You bring up a really good point so I took some time to think it over. I still don't think the University should choose which groups to recognize because the power to force clubs underground or diminish their visibility is censorship. But it's a good idea to give the University discretion over who receives money, so I'd be cool if ODUS decided to fund a group like Urban Congo with just $1, as a way of saying "We don't support you, but we support your right to say it."

83548|~|Newby Parton|~|That's not a privilege because the University shouldn't suppress ideologies. Take the Anscombe society.

83548|~|hmm|~|It begs the question for you to assert their rights within the University. That's the debate we are having -- does the University have to extend these privileges to everyone? You might stomp your feet and call it a "right" but I'd like you to justify it rather than just re-state your opinion with another example. There also might be a difference as to which types of speech are protected. Is anyone actually defending Urban Congo as a legitimate expression of a political/religious ideology or as genuine aesthetic expression?

83548|~|H_17|~|Legitimate expression of an ideology vs aesthetic expression - I think that this is one of the primary issues people have here; many believe that Urban Congo's performance explicitly or implicitly demonstrated an ideology that is targeting and offensive, while others believe that they were merely an aesthetic performance.

83548|~|hmm|~|I think the thinking would go in the opposite direction. Political speech (broadly considered) requires protection. If they're just doing some bullshit joke dance (something that might be considered aesthetic, but not really) but it is quite offensive, the University shouldn't countenance it.|~|0|~|Wednesday, April 15, 2015 11:38 AM|~|1968858732|~|1967944814|~|0
83548|~|H_17|~|But that is just it - broadly considered, legitimate, political speech should be protected. My question is how do we define what is "broadly considered" political speech? How do we create a dichotomy of speech that should be protected, or shouldn't be protected? Clearly you have a belief in a certain level of speech that should not be tolerated. Everyone has their own personally defined level of acceptable conduct, a product of their upbringing and life experience, but not every person has the same level, so beyond the bare minimum (threats, harassment, incitement to violence) how can we ever come to some uniformly acceptable level of offensiveness? Newby and others were mystified with the outrage that urban congo produced, while others were hurt and upset at the lack of empathy their peers showed. I am inclined to say that banning speech/performances/groups such as this is a very slippery slope towards suppression of ideas, but that is due to my own personal background.|~|0|~|Saturday, April 18, 2015 2:07 PM|~|1974576674|~|1968858732|~|1

In a system with decentralized authority, whoever holds the position that authorizes/funds activities has the full right to exercise that power in any legal way.

83548|~|ShadrachSmith|~|Props to Newby, he has created a musically charged Lakoffian metaphor that characterizes Princeton's moral problem of embracing every Democrat political campaign meme as revealed truth. More generally stated: The notion that Princeton's faculty ignores/dismisses the beliefs of others leaves no justification for any reasoning person to respect the beliefs that do have Princeton's apparently constructionist imprimatur. The moral path of a Social Justice Warrior is narrow as a razor's edge, and crooked as a dog's hind leg. Harshing on everyone who disagrees with the revealed truth sanctity of any current Democrat campaign meme, (eg Hands Up, War on Women, Fossil Fuels are evil, or White men symbolize racist/sexist oppression) obviously suppresses somebody's right to free speech in pursuit of 'doing the right thing'. The SJWar's moral path is cleared by Rawls' two guiding principles for Social Justice Warriors; and they are, 1) Freedom is good, unless 2) It obstructs a Democrat campaign meme...then it is to be brutally crushed without mercy or remorse, because...Justice.  What the first principle giveth, the second principle taketh away...from everybody but us. I have paraphrased Rawls' second principle a bit, but the gist and current application of the moral philosophy involved is right on :-)|~|0|~|Wednesday, April 15, 2015 10:56 AM|~|1968785024|~|NA|~|1

As I understand it, the group disbanded of their own will and all statements were made by them at their discretion. That is not censorship. By your implied definition anyone who was persuaded that something they previously said or did was mistaken has been "censored". The university did not censor Urban Congo, it affirmed the right to free speech as many pointed out the poor content of that speech at their event. If Urban Congo was, as you say, "shamed" into conformity, perhaps its members should grow the thick skin you mentioned. No one has the right not to be shamed anymore than anyone has the right not to be offended, as you wrote. Wonder how you missed this obvious parallel. Perhaps because that pose is just that, a pose, not a commitment to free expression of all kinds.|~|0|~|Tuesday, April 14, 2015 5:25 PM|~|1967680966|~|NA|~|0

Besides that I have also seen all of the instruments used to perform in both suburban and rural settings. Finally, this is a ODUS/USG approved group and students paying thousands of dollars in tuition have every right to see their school doesn't allow intentionally or incidentally offensive expression with the University logo behind it.

Obviously the University doesn't have to give everyone money etc. But it seems like dangerous precedent and short term opportunism for the left (etc.) to begin relying on institutional power to enforce the not-so-clearly-delineated (if important) norms that are, at least today, ascendant in the media and platforms many of us engage in. FWIW, none of this is to say that Urban Congo isn't idiotic and should exist.|~|1|~|Tuesday, April 14, 2015 10:43 AM|~|1966883358|~|1966210281|~|0

Is it a stretch then to say that the minority should adhere to your standards of what is funny and what is not, of what is offensive and what is not? In my opinion, a large part of the problem is the assumption that the majority does not have to respect the opinions and feelings of minority groups. To get along as a diverse population, we will have to grow to be more conscious of the perspectives of people from different identities. If the "reasonable person standard" for that underrepresented group you are targeting would find what you do/say offensive, then it is inherently alienating that group of people, and you are being offensive no matter your intentions.|~|0|~|Sunday, April 12, 2015 8:16 PM|~|1963011665|~|1957345724|~|0

Accepting sexism in a musical form, but vehemently denouncing it in all other forms perpetuates a dangerous double standard that only leads to confusion about what actually is acceptable to say and what qualifies as sexism.  If someone approached you and said “I hate these blurred lines.  I know you want it” in real life, that would be a blatant statement of rape culture.  By "consciously consuming offensive music" you are supporting rape culture and sexism because you are giving these artists the financial means to continue this perpetuation of sexism through music.  Only once we as a community stop consuming this music and stop paying for the perpetuation of it, will the culture begin to transform from one where blatant sexism is accepted and ignored, to one where it is recognized and discouraged.  We can't accept sexism in one form and expect it to go away elsewhere.|~|0|~|Saturday, April 11, 2015 8:13 PM|~|1960262999|~|NA|~|0

In fact, that's exactly when they established Fatah (1959) and the PLO (1964). They could have had a state IN PEACE after 1967, but instead, the entire Arab world issued the Khartoum Resolutions: A. No peace with Israel B. No recognition of Israel C. No NEGOTIATIONS with Israel They would have had a state IN PEACE in 2000 with the Oslo Accords, but they violently rejected it- as always. And as soon as Israel pulled every single Israeli out of Gaza, what did the would-have-been “Palestinians” do? They immediately started shooting thousands of missiles into Israeli population centers, they elected Hamas (whose official platform calls for jihad with no negotiations until Israel is destroyed) to rule them, and they have dug tunnels crossing into the Negev to kill and kidnap Israelis. And even afterwards, Ehud Olmert made his subsequent generous offer that went far beyond even that of Barak. The would-have-been "Palestinians" rejected it. They had many chances.

The NYT had an oh-so sympathetic article about one of those murderers "rebuilding his life after years in an Israeli jail." And to think all he had done was to kill a 72 year old Holocaust survivor by bashing in his skull with a metal rod.

The "peace dividend" was 14,000 rockets. Don't blame "the blockade" there was no blockade until 2007, after the Palestinians proved the need for it. The Palestinians give their schoolchildren textbooks that show no Israel - Instead, it shows an area labeled "Palestine" that includes all of what is now Israel, as well as Gaza and the West Bank. Anyone who thinks any of this provides motivation for Israel to withdraw from the West Bank needs to have their head examined. The Palestinians have made perfectly clear withdrawal from the West Bank is a suicidal option for the Israelis - and the PAlestinians as well. Should "Palestine" ever exist as a "state," rocket attacks become acts of war by one sovereign nation against another.

Remember Timothy McVeigh, the  Oklahoma City bomber?  How about Anders Breivik, the Norwegian killer?  Why pick on Islam if other religions have the same  problems? The Truth: Because  they don’t. Regardless  of what his birth certificate may or may not have said, Timothy McVeigh was not  a religious man (in fact, he stated explicitly that he was agnostic and that "science" was his religion).  At no time did he credit his deeds to religion, quote  Bible verses, or claim that he killed for Jesus.  His motives are very well documented through  interviews and research.  God is never mentioned. The  so-called “members of other faiths” alluded to by Muslims are nearly always just  nominal members who have no active involvement.  They are neither inspired  by, nor do they credit religion as Muslim terrorists do - and this is what makes  it a very different matter. Islam is  associated with Islamic terrorism because that is the association that the  terrorists themselves choose to make. Muslims who  compare crime committed by people who happen to be nominal members of other  religions to religious terror committed explicitly in the name of Islam are  comparing apples to oranges. Yes, some  of the abortion clinic bombers were religious (as Muslims enjoy pointing out),  but consider the scope of the problem.  There have been six deadly attacks over  a  36 year period in the U.S.  Eight people died.  This is an average  of one death every 4.5 years. By  contrast, Islamic terrorists staged nearly ten thousand deadly  attacks in just the six years following September 11th, 2001.  If one goes  back to 1971, when Muslim armies in Bangladesh began the mass slaughter of  Hindus, through the years of Jihad in the Sudan, Kashmir and Algeria, and the  present-day Sunni-Shia violence in Iraq, the number of innocents killed in the  name of Islam probably  exceeds five million over this same period. Anders  Breivik, who murdered 77 innocents in a lone rampage on July 22nd, 2011, was  originally misidentified as a "Christian fundamentalist" by the police.  In  fact, the killings were later determined to be politically motivated.  He  also left behind a detailed 1500 page manifesto in which he stated that he is  not religious, does not know if God exists, and prefers a secular state to a  theocracy.  Needless to say, he does not quote any Bible verses in support  of his killing spree, nor did he shout "praise the Lord" as he picked people  off. In the last  ten years, there have been perhaps a dozen or so religiously-inspired killings  by people of all other faiths combined.  No other religion  produces the killing sprees that  Islam does nearly every day of the year.  Neither do they have verses in their holy texts that arguably  support it.  Nor do they have large groups across the globe dedicated to the mass murder of people  who worship a different god, as the broader community of believers struggles  with ambivalence and tolerance for a radical clergy that supports the terror. Muslims may  like to pretend that other religions are just as subject to "misinterpretation"  as is their “perfect” one, but the reality speaks of something far worse.|~|1|~|Thursday, April 9, 2015 8:16 AM|~|1955175397|~|1954013447|~|1

82962|~|Steve Swanson '15|~|Marni, you make in important point in this article: if Jackie was victim whose account of the assault was warped by PTSD, the Rolling Stone certainly did wrong by publicizing it and then blaming her. However, you're taking all agency away from Jackie in your understanding of events. Here is what we know for certain: 1) Jackie fabricated "Haven Monihan" ("Drew") -- the handsome third-year in her chemistry class -- in order to aid her relationship with Ryan Duffin ("Randall"). We know this because there are records of the text conversations, both between Jackie and her friends, and between her friends and the false account Jackie set up for "Haven" (sample text from "Haven" re: Jackie: “She cant turn my down fro some nerd 1st yr. she said this kid is smart and funny and worth it.”) 2) On the night of Saturday, September 28th, 2012, Jackie called Kathryn Hendley, Alex Stock, and Ryan Duffin ("Cindy," "Andy," and "Randall") in emotional distress. She claimed that her date with "Haven" had ended with him taking him up to his room in a fraternity house and forced her to perform oral sex on five men. They found her outside of Fitzhugh dormitory on campus, quivering and in emotional shock. Duffin has stated that, "If she was acting on the night of Sept. 28, 2012, then she deserves an Oscar,” the only piece of evidence lending credence to the idea that something traumatic may have happened. Jackie was thus clearly willing and able to lie from the get-go in order to get what she wanted, and the person whom she blamed initially for her alleged assault is affirmatively non-existent. Furthermore, her story became more and more fantastical: what started as forced oral sex on five men ended with her being pushed into and through a glass table, the shards of which were pressed into her back for several hours as seven men forced themselves on her, the last of whom penetrated her with a beer bottle. A total fabrication, too, is the end of the story, in which her callous friends refuse to report the rape to the police because of social pressure, the Phi Psi house looming in the background. To paint Jackie's deliberate and purposeful fabrication (or embellishment) of a story, as well as her accusation of innocent parties, as "Rolling Stone, her three friends, the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and the University of Virginia and its administrators" "victimizing" her is to entirely ignore her own agency in this story.

82962|~|2012|~|Let's forget about this hypothetical 'Jackie' for a second. The entire student body, present and future, was 'victimized.' Not just for their portrayal in the media or the aspersions cast on particular institutions (vicious, hate-stoking generalizations, claims that especially call for thorough basis in evidence before they're made). Most damaging by far are the new, highly restrictive policies, this intrusive, almost universally unwanted legislation of the minutia of all social activity on campus. It was passed, with such obvious haste, opportunism (with most parties motive's somewhere on the spectrum between conformity and political coercion) at the height of the furor of the article, before the claims could even be properly be checked, let alone debunked. This legislation does violence to the whole student body, taking for granted, basically suspending, their autonomy, treating all students as de facto children. It's repulsive, terrible for UVA. I can't imagine who would actually want these new rules even within the administration.|~|1|~|Wednesday, April 8, 2015 7:40 PM|~|1953824931|~|NA|~|0
82962|~|jga9je|~|I commented above as a UVA fraternity member (with a close Princeton connection) so that's my context. I'll first discuss the knee-jerk reaction of the administration and then discuss the new rules for fraternity parties at UVA. The university responded by suspending all greek social life at UVA. This would be equivalent to suspending all eating club activity (minus actual meal service) at Princeton. The implication of this is that, in order to control partying at UVA, the administration needs Greek Life under its control. The value of Greek Life to the administration is already apparent; without it, the response to a Rolling Stone situation would be very messy at a school where more than half of students live (and party) off campus. Of course, the suspension bothered my cohort. We felt unfairly punished for the (purported, and eventually disproven) actions of a few. However, if fraternities had continue to party, I believe that tensions could have risen even higher than they did. 300 people inside a fraternity house and 300 protestors would get messy quickly. As for the party regulations: fraternities were complicit because we were given no other choice. The regulations were touted as student-driven, but they most certainly were not. When two fraternities tried to fight for their own autonomy (with the support of their national organizations), the administration was still able to push so hard that they had to cave. The rules aren't so unreasonable as to prevent partying at fraternities (if they did, parties would be driven to unorganized apartments, which, as mentioned above, is disadvantageous for the administration), but their origin leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.|~|1|~|Thursday, April 9, 2015 12:14 AM|~|1954548919|~|1953824931|~|1
82962|~|jga9je|~|UVA student, fraternity member (not of Phi Psi), and a close friend of Steve Swanson '15 here. I'd argue that Rolling Stone was the only entity that may have victimized Jackie. Every other party mentioned in the opening sentence received unfair attention and treatment.     -     Her three friends were displayed as callous, insensitive, and absurdly shallow.     -     Phi Psi was made out to be a house full of sociopathic gang rapists.     -     UVA students were made out to be superficial and overwhelmingly "blonde and preppy." Furthermore, they were accused of creating and tolerating a culture that almost celebrated rape. The "UVrApe" nickname was almost certainly coined by Erdely or Jackie, and that song that punctuates each section of the article is in no way a fight song. Most students have never heard that song, or never heard anything after the first stanza.     -     Dean Eramo, a sexual assault survivors advocate loved by all who she supports, is purported to have told Jackie that "no one wants to send their daughters to a Rape School." (A quote that, like many other "facts" in the article, came via Jackie herself). Phi Psi is suing because they are the most infamous fraternity in America, and they did nothing to earn that reputation. If that lawsuit indeed "[bolsters] the false narrative of girls crying rape," the blame lies with Rolling Stone. If RS had picked a true story of sexual assault on a college campus (and of course, they exist), there would be no lawsuit.|~|1|~|Wednesday, April 8, 2015 2:03 PM|~|1953194149|~|NA|~|1
82962|~|Frustrated '15|~|It's never the victim's fault, but accusing someone wrongly is a crime too. Rolling Stone certainly failed as a medium of publication and failed to uphold journalistic integrity, and was utterly shameless in pinning the blame on "Jackie" without taking any preventative / retributive steps, but that doesn't excuse her from having made claims that may have well destroyed lives of innocent people (c.f. Duke Lacross case, 2006). The immediate victim, as far as this case is concerned, is UVa and the fraternity in question, though the fallout obviously will be hugely detrimental to the other survivors. Girls crying rape _is_ a false narrative, but it's important to note that that the 'false narrative' actually happened here. You're assuming that 'something had happened to her' - that she was a victim in some other case that may have occurred. I think someone mentioned this in response to one of your articles in the past, but allegations or other situational indicators do not automatically make someone a 'victim'. Until proven guilty, there is the accused and the accuser, not the victim and the perpetrator. This type of coded language is dangerous to fact-finding, and is precisely what enabled this incident. Obviously, this case should not be used to dismiss sexual assault claims, because that is a serious issue that we should all care about and aim to prevent; as you've said, though, the pattern of failure draws a map of how to do better, and I feel the way to go is to have resources for support and prevention, rather than butchering constitutional rights and fact-finding integrity after the fact.|~|1|~|Wednesday, April 8, 2015 12:12 AM|~|1952118141|~|NA|~|0
82962|~|2012|~|"Its never the victim's fault..." What if, hypothetically, you could know for a fact that the story is entirely false? Let's not talk about 'false narrative' as a general phenomenon for a second, but instead hypothetically look at one particular example and assume that this particular narrative is absolutely false. Would the girl who tells the story still be 'the victim' in your formulation? And moreover, would this girl bear no blame whatsoever for what transpires following the publication of the story? Anyone who uses a the outcome of a particular case as a bases to judge a separate, totally unrelated case, with its own separate evidence, is obviously committing an error of judgment. But to just assume that people general will do so in this current case-to the extent that some people are even reluctant to admit that Jackie's story is false, or do so only reluctantly and always with an addendum (redundantly! see above) emphasizing that this isn't a basis for dismissing other rape cases, or people even more inexplicably assume that there must be some separate 'true' and equally incriminating story that just ins't being told-this very paranoid to me, and sadly almost universal. Who are there editorials actually talking to when they say that the result of this case is not an excuse to dismiss future accounts of rape? Who is their actual audience, and do they mean to insult it but imputing it the intelligence of a fucking neanderthal? Who are you talking to, Frustrated '15?|~|1|~|Wednesday, April 8, 2015 8:02 PM|~|1953853761|~|1952118141|~|0

As you would have seen if you read my comment, I've written that the assumption of the existence of alternative 'true' incriminating stories is ridiculous and detrimental to fact-finding. The main point that I was trying to make is that while I care about sexual assault, this example should be used to raise awareness about difficulties in fact-checking and how agendas influence the process rather than making blanket claims (on both sides). The addendum is important to me because people like Susan Patton exist, but that's on the level of the takeaway (alongside the "stop butchering constitutional rights and fact-finding integrity to fit with your agenda" to the activists) and has nothing to do with the facts of this story, which is that "Jackie" lied.|~|0|~|Thursday, April 9, 2015 12:52 AM|~|1954631408|~|1953853761|~|0

82962|~|tellthetruth|~|The radical feminist viewpoint is the norm in America and in law enforcement and government like with the University of Virginia rape case.  Many feminists are saying “so what if she lied about rape and might put innocent men in jail. We should still believe her and help her spread the message since it is raising awareness about rape.  They make up false statistics that no one bothers to check.  Of course even a lying woman telling a false made up rape claim accusing innocent men of rape need to be called a "hero"  a "survivor" or "victim" even if she is not. The feminist  women's groups on college campus, in law enforcement, government in America believe that when a woman says yes to sex --she really means no. No matter what the woman says or does the answer to sex is always --NO!     YES means NO!  No means NO, maybe means NO,  silence means NO.  If she gets sexy and physical with a man, and says she wants sex,  the man must realize the answer is still NO!  and walk away.   Or he can be accused of rape 10 years later if she decides that she didn’t “feel” comfortable ten years ago during the sex. Because what woman in their right mind would ever consent to having sex with a man?  - This is typical feminist logic which is the way the laws are written.     It is considered rape to have sex with a drunk woman since the law states that she can’t consent. If a sober man has sex with a drunk woman he can be charged with rape, when both the man and the woman are equally drunk the man can be charged with rape, when the man is drunk and the WOMAN is SOBER the man can be charged with rape. When it comes to sex the man is always wrong and the woman is always right  - the way the feminist laws are written. There are many feminist women's groups who lobby the government and make the government and Law enforcement believe that all men are evil and all women are angels that can do no wrong when it comes to SEX.  The way the laws are written sexual assault is anything the woman thinks it is.  Trying to kiss a woman and being rejected can be sexual assault.  Flirting with a woman who you find out later is not interested can be sexual assault.  Trying to hold hands with woman who is not interested can be sexual assault.   Sexual assault according to the way American laws are written is anything that the woman feels is unwanted sexual advances.   Which could be anything she doesn’t like and takes it be something that she thinks is sexual.    It is tough being a single man in America.|~|1|~|Tuesday, April 7, 2015 9:22 PM|~|1951918287|~|NA|~|1

82958|~|Steve Swanson '15|~|I'm just going to go ahead and copy-paste my comments from Zeena Mubarak's column, as this one also accepts her assumption that the Urban Congo members knowingly chose their name. This certainly would be a very serious issue if the name Congo were a direct reference to the Congo river, the DRC, or the RC. It is perfectly reasonable that viewers would have taken this interpretation, and seen the performance as a parody of the Eurocentric, Western understanding of African tribes. However, despite the appearance of such prejudice, Urban Congo members had no intention of referencing an African country with their name. Ask any of them: "conga" and "bongo" are both the names of rhythmic instruments, and their name is an accidental conflation of these two words. The fact that they existed forover a year prior to this incident demonstrates that their misunderstanding of the meaning of "Congo" was quite widespread -- if they had performed this act at the PVC Talent Show in 2013 under the name "Urban Zaire," or "Urban Rwanda," backlash would have been harsh and immediate. The only wrong committed by Urban Congo was their oversight in choosing a name. This certainly was a negligent misstep, and it led to incidental psychological harm to their viewers, but an oversight is all it was. Without the "African" context lent by the name,the performance is not at all problematic -- it is a reference to a tribal history shared by all humankind, not a specific parody of any culture (this is evidenced by the fact that detractors accused Urban Congo of somehow appropriating both African and Native American cultures). In short, the performance was offensive, but only incidentally so. People should not be attempting to read this as part of a larger pattern of racism or cultural insensitivity at this school or in certain groups. Once it has been established that Urban Congo made a legitimate, if negligent, mistake for which they are contrite, it is time to move on.  Note, too, that the Wikipedia disambiguation pages for both "Congo" and "Conga" list the other in their "See Also" sections: clearly, this is a widespread mistake. People also mistake "chilli" and "Chile"; "hungry" and "Hungary"; "grease" and "Greece"; "turkey" and "Turkey." And those are just the ones related to food. I have personally heard people confuse Dominica and the Dominican Republic; Georgia and Georgia; Guinea, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Guyana; Iran and Iraq (until our recent involvements there); Liberia and Libya; Lichtenstein, Lithuania, and Luxembourg; Mauritania and Mauritius; Slovakia and Slovenia; and even Austria and Australia. The point is, there are a lot of countries out there, many of whose names sound like each other and like other nouns.

Certainly. Does it make me a racist? Certainly not. How exactly would "Urban Bongo" be problematic?

The jab at Hauss and his "milquetoast apology" here is completely unwarranted. Honestly, he gave one of the more sincere and thoughtful apologies I've heard in any of the various conversations we've had about race on this campus. It's public on his FB page, but for those who have not seen it, I think it needs to be part of the conversation. It's evidence of actual progress and understanding occurring, without defensiveness, which is pretty rare. Please don't put him down for admitting fault and taking full responsibility. "To the Princeton community: I understand that no apology will ever make up for the harm I have caused. I have tried countless times to write the “correct” words, but it always seems artificial. I have never dealt with this type of situation before, and have no formula to properly handle it. All I can do is express my thoughts and intentions from this point forward. I have never considered myself an insensitive person, but am now deeply upset by the reality of my actions. Urban Congo did not intend to offend any person or culture. We wanted to provide an environment in which all students could relieve stress and develop relationships through spontaneous, unprocessed percussion. I am embarrassed that my ignorance extended so far as to equate the words “conga” and “bongo” with “Congo.” We are mortified that our desire to convey the primal nature of our beats enabled us to overlook the cultural implications of our performances. But intent is not what is important now. In ignorance we created something undeniably offensive. We are disappointed that there are people that empathize with our plight rather than with those who have been hurt by our actions. But we cannot change these things. What we can do is use this as an opportunity to confront our ignorance, and work to open broader dialogues about cultural diversity and understanding in our community. We must use this as an opportunity to improve the cultural environment on this campus. The members of this group are wholeheartedly committed to confronting our ignorance. We plan to engage in discussions with the Carl A. Fields Center for Equality and Cultural Understanding, as well as with student groups and the university at large. I encourage all members of the Princeton community with concerns to reach out to me. My email is mhauss@princeton.edu. I would love the opportunity to talk to anyone who has been offended, and will make myself available at anytime.

Plus the name "Urban Congo" was probably a twist on the store "Urban Cargo" like someone else pointed out. Yes the guys need to know that their performance was culturally insensitive, but we should try to teach them and not punish them or make them feel like crap just to prove a point about race, culture etc. They seem like a bunch of clueless guys to me.

I felt many times that my country and my culture were misrepresented but I also saw this mechanism coming from college students, and, instead of accusing them of being racist I tried  to explain them what the difference between the stereotype and the reality was. I think that most of the times being in such a high-level institution gives us the duty and responsibility to TEACH rather than to ACCUSE, or at least to convince people that they are wrong in doing what they do and that whatever they are doing is just not appropriate.

Fault Urban Congo for not thinking their name through sufficiently, but don't try to draw any deeper conclusions than that.|~|3|~|Tuesday, April 7, 2015 9:38 AM|~|1950709180|~|1950355414|~|1

And that's one of my favorite songs! Argh! Random thought. Anyway, I doubt the guys on the swimming team and diving team meant any harm or malice. I thought the performance was silly but the guys looked serious during their performance so I guess they did not mean it to be a spoof about a culture. Plus the name "Urban Congo" was probably a twist on the store "Urban Cargo" like someone else pointed out. Yes the guys need to know that their performance was culturally insensitive, but we should try to teach them and not punish them or make them feel like crap just to prove a point about race, culture etc. They seem like a bunch of clueless guys to me. Random question though: why do so many people I know think the movie White Chicks is ok ? I thought it was totally racist, but I guess this is where I disagree with everyone else once again.

They did not realize their effect on others at all because they were living in the moment like the loud student audience members, who were even MORE offensive with the cheering and screaming during the entire dance performance. This may seem fun but it undermines the dancers, cheapens the performance and is inappropriate. This incredible dance company worked hard, putting each component together to build a wonderful show with amazing talent. Where was the respect for those dancers? It just shows you that most college students will happily partake in all kinds of nonsense without thinking. Why would urban congo or Princeton be any different? It was not a sporting event. The kids screaming behind me ruined my night. I drove two hours to see dance, and was distracted by the constant noise of college kids needing attention.

It's a good point - plenty of people DON'T have the luxury of not considering job opportunities when picking a major, and if they think art history means they won't be land a job after college, they might not major in something they'd otherwise be good at. For people like that, finding out that art history does not preclude financial success is a good reason to major in it, not because it adds a "pro" (e.g. is lucrative) but rather removes a "con (makes you unemployable).|~|1|~|Monday, April 6, 2015 12:13 AM|~|1948465505|~|1948292251|~|0

82172|~|'17|~|(This turned out much longer than intended, but hopefully adds some more nuanced perspective.) While I agree that institutional change can and perhaps should be implemented, I urge you to consider: why, in fact, is it important to increase community-based service? The various demands and efforts - academic, extracurricular, social, financial, spiritual, etc. - that can push and pull on students here offer ample opportunities to give, to serve, to learn, to become humble, to grow. So I would say not to straight up discount all of these things, which is kind of how your piece reads. Yes, lots of Pace center efforts struggle thanks to leadership and volunteer shortcomings, but also from difficulties with community partners, conflicts with schedules, and imperfect communication. And more often than not, the students who are invested in the greater community are usually quite invested in the Princeton community as well, and they run into problems with overcommitment and simply trying to not forget about their academics. I don't think it's possible to be properly outward-looking without being quite intentionally and thoughtfully inward-looking, too. So yes we could have more students who are actively dedicated to service, and this could be better promoted as a valuable thing by the institution, but I guess my main points are 1) meaningful service IS conducted by students at this University, both externally and internally (maybe you're not hearing about it because it's not glamorous..or the people doing it aren't touting it around or complaining about it), and not infrequently by students for whom service IS their main thing and 2) being civic-minded can happen within on-campus contexts as well, and spur much individual and relational growth, which isn't all prestige-based. Also, I think this is very much something that depends on your social circle. Perhaps my perspective is such because I feel like I'm surrounded by individuals who are passionate about their on-campus communities and also are dedicated to serving others off-campus. Even though I was cynical about Pace as a freshman as well, I've learned that many people within it, though not all, are putting in a lot of effort to serve others - through Breakout, CA, and student groups structurally, and also just being really awesome caring people. But there are definitely groups - social and otherwise - on campus that have little to no community involvement - oftentimes not even with the Princeton community, so how can you expect them to involve with the community beyond that? Your title is especially demeaning to the people who do care, and also kind of click bait. I agree with your call for a culture shift at large, but not the writing off of the hundreds of students who are engaging as best as they can. Remember always, especially in non-profit and volunteer worlds, perfect is the enemy of good.|~|0|~|Wednesday, April 1, 2015 12:26 PM|~|1940200340|~|NA|~|0

Keep it up, Reva!|~|0|~|Wednesday, April 1, 2015 2:45 AM|~|1939415022|~|NA|~|1
82172|~|Alum|~|Wow, thanks for saying the most important and meaningful part of my 4 years here was instead commitment "just to the image." I worked as a volunteer EMT throughout my time at Princeton. I spent way too many hours doing that, to the detriment of both my academics and my other extracurriculars, including writing for this newspaper. I found extraordinary meaning in my traditional community service, and I loved working the ambulance for its own sake. Moreover, my community service has not been a detriment to my career at all, and indeed, played a huge role in my getting into medical school and launching my career as a physician. Thanks for your sweeping generalization. It's not insulting at all. However, I do agree that there needs to be a culture change at this University. One very tangible form of culture change is with money. Money can fund things like the PACE cars, the few of which we have are falling apart. The University lives in denial that we live in suburbia. In order to do anything meaningful off campus (close by, not in New York or abroad), you need a car, and the University makes vehicle access very difficult for students. Another, less tangible, way is for the administration and students to treat its neighbors with respect. Students and faculty often think of New Jersey with contempt, including both Princeton (the town) and Trenton. Look no more than Shirley Tilghman's attitude towards the town of Princeton and its residents - they were merely bugs for her to squash. Students also think of townies with contempt, and the little interaction they have with townies is on Nassau Street. Eisgruber has set the tone a little better, but it's to be seen whether he is leading a meaningful change. Community service that isn't lip service isn't going to come without respect for the community first.|~|0|~|Tuesday, March 31, 2015 10:41 PM|~|1939197493|~|NA|~|0

Where does he stay in Delhi? So far, via pics from his facebook pg, I’ve seen him grace just about every 5-star hotel in Delhi (at least 3 or 4 times a year for a substantial stay): Raddison, Hyatt, The Crown… what impact has his lifestyle had on the environment?  http://www.ndtv.com/delhi-news...   Scroll through these pictures also:  http://www.aljazeera.com/indep... Question him on how the Monasteries are coping with the gas cylinder quotas. Have they reverted to wood fuel? Ask him how they dispose of the garbage. Do they burn it? Dump it? Recycle? Yes, they hold an eco-dharma conference every year in Delhi, but what have they actually done? I have my own experiences posted on my fb pg. Yeah, I can look out my window at the Gonpa in India and tell you everything is bad also. Before we label someone’s message as “relevant” we have to really look at who they are—what they are saying versus what are actually doing. If he really cares about equal rights, well there are 20-30 women in the traditional 3-year retreat in America right now—he should go there and teach them—not just have a brief “meet and greet” kata ceremony and then quickly move on to his next scheduled “event.” He really needs to go to the Drupkangs to chant with the practitioners and to teach.|~|0|~|Tuesday, March 31, 2015 10:58 AM|~|1938029603|~|NA|~|1

I went to the Bill Deresiewicz debate because he challenged our assumptions about the value of the education we're all getting. And I went to see the Dalai Lama because his leadership and life is fundamentally different from what we see here day-to-day.

This is not to say that minorities should stay invisible, but there's a difference between letting people have their place of worship and having their message publicly blasted through speakers. I'm probably in the minority, but I'm also opposed to Grad College carillons playing Christian music.

You may believe that our own University has been far too tolerant of a pervasive rape culture. Or your feelings may lie somewhere in between. "- um, aren't those ideas the same side of a spectrum?" Or, at least they aren't exactly "opposing" viewpoints.  I would hope that writers for the Princetonian (or at least it's editors) would try to be a little more careful about crafting an argument. (To the author, I've noticed poor logic in other recent articles, so my comments are not meant to single you out). But as an adult reader to your paper, I find this trend of "misleading statements" to be disturbing, and wished to point it out.  Maybe if you wrote something like, "You may personally feel that the pervasiveness of sexual misconduct on college campuses has been grossly exaggerated. Or you may feel that the reporting of actual sexual assaults on campuses has been frighteningly under-reported." IE: Two OPPOSING viewpoints, then your follow-up statement of, "Or your feelings may lie somewhere in between." would be more logical.|~|0|~|Wednesday, April 1, 2015 3:28 AM|~|1939446466|~|NA|~|0
81886|~|E. O.|~|There's a line between conducting a survey and fanning the flames of fear & distrust. This survey, I feel, has crossed that line. This survey forces students to wallow in a pit of sexual misconduct and may make women fearful of men and men fearful of witch-hunts of sexual misconduct. Did anybody do a preliminary study to see how this survey affects sexual attitudes? Was a preliminary study conducted to see how this survey affects sexual attitudes BEFORE it was introduced to a large pool of college students (and pushed on them through repeated emails to their college accounts)? Does this survey make women fearful of aggression and sexual misconduct by men? Does this survey make men fearful of false accusations of sexual misconduct? It certainly affected my attitude. You can't ask questions like: "Have you been harrassed by a ___insert-underrepresented-minority-here____ man?" to an insular pool of hundreds of impressionable college students and claim that "we are just trying to find out the truth of racial relations".  Survey questions are not neutral - a survey asking "do you think person A is a murderer and a rapist?" can change a naive participants' attitudes towards person A, especially if the survey is coming from an official source such as a committee for the investigation of murderers and rapists. This survey may make women into social hypocondriacs who see symptoms of sexual misconduct that are not there (WITCH!!), make males fearful of accusations of sexual misconduct and old boys less willing to extend their networks to women in order to buffer themselves from possible allegations. There are serious issues of research ethics here. It is wrong to pollute the waters of a community without some precaution about the social health of the community and without the community's consent. One precaution would be to spread out this survey across many college campuses to dilute the poisonous effects across a large scale. Another would be to carefully re-design the survey to ensure that it doesn't lead to strong, negative reactions. I am greatly offended by this survey - it has caused me to worry about false accusations of sexual misconduct and that worry structures how I interact with women in a negative way. I am much more comfortable sharing my social capital with other men who will not accuse me of sexual misconduct and this survey is not helping me break down that wall of sexual professional preference.

That doesn't mean their numbers are right; in fact, because we know the crime is underreported, we know that their numbers are wrong. Or, as you might say, false. You (who I have to guess, from your attitude, are male) can run around spouting a number that's known to be incorrect all you want, but it just shows ignorance and refusal to honestly debate issues.

If you assume that his attitude implies he's a male and simultaneously hate on his attitude, I'm even more concerned that this investigation of sexual attitudes is turning into a witch hunt of males. One major concern that '15 is perfectly justified in raising is that unreliable stats that confirm sexual biases (in this case that male behavior is bad) - and possibly the survey as well - change peoples' attitudes towards members of different sexes, and cultivate the kind of attitude-male-misconduct/BAD associations that we are seeing in your response to '15's fair claim. Let me give an example that I hope provokes you to recognize our position (and feel free to comment on the content contained herein! ad hominem/gender attacks discouraged): Some poorly conducted survey comes out asking guys if they thought women were bossy. 30% of guys said they had been bossed by a women in the past month (plus or minus 30% given the possible bias in participation). To prevent this sexual misconduct at our campus, we conducted a survey in a group of impressionable young students already stressed out with school and already a little insecure with their position in the community whether or not they had been bossed by women in the past month. This survey feeds the cultural diet of these students and unintentionally implies to guys that some of their stress and insecurity could be caused by bossy women, arming guys with a new and seemingly legitimate way of disregarding women exercising self-confidence. Someone in an online forum says that this survey is based on bad statistics. "You're being bossy," says one reply in an online thread, "so that must mean you're a woman." But hey - we're just trying to get to the truth! You, the bossy one, are (insert insults here), and I am just trying to deal with this problem of bossy women being bossy all the time (did I say that women are bossy?) that is behind this survey where many men, for fear of upsetting a woman or because they are too busy, did not report that they were bossed by a woman in the past month.|~|0|~|Wednesday, April 1, 2015 3:25 PM|~|1940544516|~|1937745998|~|1

They are incredibly generous with financial aid and many people I've spoken to (and I, personally) received a better deal here than literally any other school (including state school). The type of student that chooses Harvard, Yale, or Stanford over Princeton doesn't do so because of the costs. I'm obviously biased, but given Princeton's reputation as having the strongest undergraduate program in the country, I'd say a majority of them go elsewhere for the prestige of those universities (something, unfortunately, Princeton would lose as a result of a tuition policy like this). And I'm not saying that free education is a bad idea at all--but knowing most of the students on this campus, do you really believe that they'd be the same pompous, self-righteous, elitist Princetonians they are if they didn't know their education had the same valuation as their peers'?|~|2|~|Sunday, March 29, 2015 11:46 PM|~|1935414379|~|NA|~|0

81883|~|'15|~|You misunderstand the math behind endowment spending. First, note that Princeton has to spend 5% of its endowment every year to maintain non-profit status, which it does. So using the long-run endowment return of 10% (which we should expect it to maintain in the long run, although that may be optimistic going forward), the endowment is only growing net of expenses at roughly 5% per year. The budget is similarly growing at 5% per year.  If Princeton spends more now on financial aid / other items, a few things will happen: a) The endowment will grow at less than 5% NET per year (i.e. return minus spending) b) The budget will continue growing at 5% per year, and might increase as it grows to fill new spending This means the endowment will be growing (net) at less than the rate of spending. If the endowment grows at less than the rate of the budget, the endowment will start shrinking and will eventually approach 0. This is clearly not an acceptable option - as much as we talk about sustainable investing, we also have to be mindful of sustainable *spending.* A significant increase in the portion of the budget from the endowment to eliminate tuition is clearly *not* sustainable. If Princeton reduces its spending on other items or at least constrains the long-run rate of spending growth, then spending more of the endowment to eliminate tuition could be sustainable, but that is not the case currently. Remember, it's not like Princeton hasn't done this math, and you can be sure they've done it with more accurate numbers and with deeper analysis than you have. I'm sure the administration would love to make Princeton truly free if they could, but currently, they cannot.|~|1|~|Sunday, March 29, 2015 9:54 PM|~|1935319335|~|NA|~|0

It is better to have an official list price that nobody pays than to market yourself as a cheap alternative to other schools. After all, if dropping tuition improved the perception of a good-quality school, then the Cooper Union and Rice University (both free at one time) would have risen in the rankings.

Even if the stats say that almost everyone gets a full-tuition scholarship, you'll still feel special. Princeton, on the other hand, will appear to be a lesser school compared to those two, especially for the select few to whom a few thousand dollars difference in cost is not meaningful.

81883|~|Alum and Mom of Alum|~|Reasons why Princeton's yield is low: 1. Post-Christmas exams, which prevent students from fully enjoying Christmas break and put them at a disadvantage when it comes to internship recruiting.  2. Mandatory Thesis and JP, which are incredibly time consuming and stressful, and which receive virtually no recognition by employers (especially those outside finance/consulting) and grad schools. No other school has a JP and theses are not mandatory for graduation elsewhere. 3. Grade Deflation, which was a problem until it was "abolished" this year; we will see how things actually change over time.  4. Eating Clubs and "Underground" Greek Life: no other Ivy League schools have eating clubs, which don't exactly have the best reputation outside of school, and which are a lot more pervasive on campus than things like Harvard's final clubs or Yale's secret societies.  5. Difficulty Studying Abroad: Study Abroad is virtually impossible for econ, science, math, and engineering majors, and students in other majors often don't go abroad anyway. These problems have all existed for decades, but the underground Greek life that has developed since my time at Princeton has exacerbated the competition for getting into the bicker clubs, which has become so much more vicious and mean-spirited and has resulted in bitterness, hurt feelings and resentment for too many Princeton  students. Meanwhile, in over 30 years, the other problems are no closer to being solved than they were back then. What is most incredible is that the University has been unable and/or unwilling to change the academic calendar to a pre-Christmas exam schedule, when almost every college in the nation (including Harvard, which made the switch seven years ago) has done so. It is so unfair to all the students who are trying to enjoy their holidays with their families and other college friends, but especially for west coast and international students, who may only get to go home once during the academic year and even then must still be preoccupied with papers and finals upon their return to campus in January. If President Eisgruber and the powers that be at Princeton think that this is not an important factor in determining whether accepted students decide to attend Princeton, they should think again. In short, with all these reasons not to attend Princeton, free tuition may be what is needed in order to increase the matriculation yield of accepted students to a level higher than that of Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. • Reply • Share ›|~|0|~|Monday, March 30, 2015 11:20 AM|~|1936091125|~|NA|~|1
81780|~|JW'15 |~|With respect to other commenters, the class of this writer really shouldn't matter, although it's a sophomore. Perhaps for a topic like bicker that criticism is valid, but certainly not here. With respect to Princeton parent's children, citing their experience they share with you, as "anecdata" of a sort, is as far as I can tell as an actual student here, both weak as an argument and an exception from the normal PDF-ing student. I personally am also an advocate of pushing the deadline back. It hinges on what you think the intent of giving the PDF option is. If it is truly to let students engage in classes outside their normal academic sphere without fear of repercussions on their transcript, it absolutely should be valid on the first day of class or the last to elect the PDF option. I sincerely wonder what motivation the U. has in not allowing this, as students certainly feel like they would engage more with a  class they *might* take for a grade, as opposed to one they won't at all. And the faculty would have more engaged students. The author makes a good point w/ respect to a P being equivalent to a C if the change occurred; how far is it from the case now? A good friend of mine believes that the art of PDF-ing is to "be as close to a seventy as possible". It implies a perfect allocation of minimal work to an equivalent result given the lack of fidelity of a PDF grade. Why incentivize mediocrity?|~|0|~|Sunday, March 29, 2015 4:41 PM|~|1935027907|~|NA|~|0

Surely, there were more appropriate ones. Many, if not all, of this writer's "assumptions" are faulty. For ex, my daughter is a horrific writer, yet she is P/D/Fing a course which requires a ton of writing, including the midterm and final, and I can ASSURE YOU, that she is working as hard, no, HARDER in this class, than in any of her "graded ones". I really find the assumptions & conclusions made in this article quite harmful and offensive.

Administrators, please  do NOT consider dropping the P/D/F option as a singular (or even 2?) Princetonian writers do NOT speak for the entire community.

Students and parents of students should have been immediately notified (at least via private correspondence if not public publication) if the cause of death was a potential homicide, or a medical issue, or a suicide, etc. Why? So that they could protect themselves. And so there could be increased awareness. And so people could be reassured if it were NOT a homicide or medical issue,etc. If it were a potential homicide, clearly that should be revealed and if medical (ie: meningitis, measles, ebola, other? - then ABSOLUTELY the community should also be notified) and with a suicide, it allows parents and students to discuss what occurred without having to "second guess" the cause of death. The only thing the original article said, I recall, was that "foul play" was not suspected, but no follow-up information confirming that or sharing the cause was ever published by the university from what I could locate. (If I am wrong, I apologize, but I searched and couldn't locate any). Even the above article never explicitly states the cause. Why are you so reluctant to come out and outright STATE that this was a "suicide"?

We need a paradigm shift that recognizes that female athletes and teams are not inferior; they are just different." In some sports, the women are more interesting to watch. E.g. Tennis in my opinion because the rallies last longer. The reality is though that in most sports, the men ARE faster and stronger and that makes for a more entertaining product. Like dance or theater, sports are yet another type of performance. The simple fact is that often times (but not always), the men are more entertaining to watch than the women. That's not to say that there shouldn't be emphasis promoting women's sports. You agree that women's sports are different and the truth is that often times the entertainment IS inferior. What's more, you admit that you don't even follow sports much. How can you then have a valid opinion on the merits of being a sports fan if you don't even appreciate that form of entertainment? As a feminist myself, I find it annoying when people make incompetent feminist arguments that try to deny legitimate differences in genders.

81323|~|'15|~|Good column, Marni. I agree with most of the points you raised here, and I think we definitely have a long way to go in terms of bring women's sports to the attention of the mainstream viewer. Princeton's women's team definitely deserved more attention (and a higher seed to boot). However, I'd like to contest one of the points you made about the style of play of women's and men's teams. "In general, women’s teams place more emphasis on teamwork, and less on individual play. But that doesn’t mean that is or should be any less interesting to watch. Those who claim it is less interesting do so simply because we have been taught that a certain style of game play is interesting — not because it inherently is." Teamwork is not exclusively limited to the women's game, and several men's teams have proven that it can be exciting - one only needs to look at the Spurs in 2014, or the Showtime Lakers, or even the Hawks this year. They move the ball around at such a fast pace and it is such a joy to watch. There are a number of reasons why people prefer watching men's college basketball over women's college basketball. For example, in the past 13 years, only five different teams have won national championships in the women's tournament - UConn with six, Tennessee with three, Baylor with two, and Maryland and Texas A&M with one apiece. This year, UConn is the prohibitive favorite to win its third straight title, and seventh in 14 years. On the other hand, in that same time period, the men's tournament has had nine different winners, with no team winning more than three times (also UConn), and no team winning more than two in a row (Florida). There is a lot more parity in the men's game - even though traditional powerhouses like Kentucky, Duke and UNC always factor in, they have only combined to win 4 titles in the last 13 years - less than the UConn women. Additionally, one of the greatest things about the men's tournament is the possibility of an upset - this year, Princeton was only the second Ivy team to ever win a game in the women's tournament, while Harvard's men won both of their games as a double-digit seed in 2013 and 2014. Something like Georgia State's incredible win over Baylor is much more likely to happen in the men's tournament, and that's why people love filling out brackets - the possibility that the bracket is busted. Finally, one of the main reasons why people watch sports (and entertainment in general) is because athletes tend to push the boundaries of what humans can realistically do. It's like listening to Thom Yorke go for and sustain the incredibly long note in the bridge of "Creep" - you see him pushing and pushing and achieving things never thought possible. It's why we're fascinated with Usain Bolt running, or Phelps swimming, or Nadia Comanecci perform her gymnastic routine - because they push the boundaries of what we thought was humanly possible. Basketball is the same way - it's nice to see a backdoor cut lead to an easy layup, but it's much more breathtaking to see Vince Carter do a windmill 360 dunk, or Willie Cauley-Stein of Kentucky impose his will defensively. It's inherently more exciting because it's more physically difficult.|~|0|~|Monday, March 23, 2015 9:31 PM|~|1924484829|~|NA|~|0

81256|~|Life is risky|~|Princeton students have to understand sooner or later that you don't have ultimate control over your life and how you are judged.  To get accepted at Princeton, you've come to the table with some form of advantage, either natural smarts, natural talent, parental resources, parental management, or superior skills of execution and strategy, whatever edge you had, you needed it, and then from your resource base, you've lived a life of smarts, strategy and discipline and you've heretofore been able to control the outcome of "merit" assessment sufficiently to get yourself here.  But at some point, no matter how smart, resourced, and strategic you are, the control ends.  You'll understand this better when someone else's startup succeeds after yours fails (and you both had equally good ideas, investment and drive), when your buddy (or you) get a terrible form of cancer that no one deserves, when your kid's car is hit by a drunk driver, when you get out there and life a grown ups life, you'll get that all that achievement and "grade" stuff, just isn't exactly how the real world rolls.  Fortunately for you, you'll have the resource of your Princeton education, status and relationships, so you may well fare better than others, but you don't get to P/D/F cancer or parenthood, etc. So just go ahead and take that risky "curiosity" class.  Or, forgo it and accept yourself as risk adverse.  I'll never jump out of an airplane and I accept that I'll never experience the thrill of skydiving, so be it. Students should register for all classes expecting the normal grading system to apply.  There should be a deadline late in the semester by which a student can opt to P/D/F the class.  There should be no "rescinding" of the P/D/F.  Take responsibility for your choice, and move on.  There should be a limit to the number of P/D/Fs that can be exercised by semester, by year, and in total.  (There should probably be some sort of special option for "tragic or traumatic circumstances" allowing a student to P/D/F their whole slate of classes in one semester, if necessary.) I'm surprised that such achievement oriented students would even want the P/D/F option to be rescindable.

81256|~|Bennett McIntosh|~|Wrong. This would do nothing but increase the pressure in classes which students are taking as low-pressure exploration.

If we want to encourage exploration, the P/D/F option has to both remove the consequences of doing mediocre and the pressure to achieve.  |~|0|~|Monday, March 23, 2015 8:43 AM|~|1923155153|~|NA|~|1

Your proposal also asks students to select the PDF option without complete information, which is unfair to risk-averse students.

How many peer universities (Top 50) have similar options for their students?  How might you anticipate this to impact the average G.P.A at the university? You give an opinion, but don't do any legwork or research to back up your claims. Also, your suggestion that students don't do work if using the P/D/F option should not be accurate, since wouldn't this result in a D or F?|~|0|~|Monday, March 23, 2015 2:51 AM|~|1922885501|~|NA|~|0

The fact is 90% of graduate students ignore GSC, and it is run by group of minority who are there to add couple lines to their resume to get a consulting job. Plus, I personally know many of them also joined GSG to enjoy the prioirty in housing draw! What an irony when they are writing this elaborated piece of "parting" essay on graduate housing issue. Just look at what they have accomplished so far - NOTHING at all beyond hosting parties and pizza gathering with the compulsory fee they collected from graduate student. Nothing! Browse some of their Facebook page and you will see how  much of our money has been spent on satisfying their own pleasure and comfort with the small circle of friends they have. GSG doesn't actually care about the well-being of graduate students, and most graduate students don't care about GSG at all. Interview any random graduate student and you will know this is hardly a surprise. I remember in the last graduate student orientation - Sean would have to offer free drinking bottle for anyone to stay for 5 secs to listen to him - almost everyone would leave with the bottle and ignore what he was mumbling (without realizing that those plastics were bought using the GSG fee that they themselves were forced to pay every year.) I think it is a better Princeton for graduate students if we eliminate GSG. Or at least stop forcing us to pay the GSG fee every year to support their own personal interest.

The average undergrad often considers his thesis to be real research/ the result of his own work, and the university trumpets it as such. The first year graduate students that you speak of generally know that what they are doing is crap, and work to improve over time.  In reality, the senior thesis is simply an extension of a teaching lab. If you want to call this thing a senior thesis, at least hold it to some standard and be willing to fail those who put in no effort (oh wait...we don't fail people at Princeton because then an angry parent may call in and complain for their 22 year old child).

81050|~|David|~|Come on - you are not a kid anymore; complaining about housing is like asking mommy daddy to continue to feed you after pre-school; as an adult you should be able to find your own bed! University housing beyond undergraduate is a luxury for graduate student. Princeton is particularly expensive region, and 70% of coverage is itself very generous, considering that housing subsidy re-directed our undergraduate tuition and alumni endowment to graduate students' personal comfort - whom by the way, doesn't need to pay a cent in tuition, and received generous stipend while earning their degree here. Many of graduate students actually moved out of campus voluntarily because they like to live on their own! This issue has been sensationalized by the GSG for their own private interest. They are having difficulty convincing graduate student community about their own existence whom are forced to continue to pay the member fee every year. Campus recreation is a thing for undergraduate, but sadly many were expecting the same experience when joining graduate school. "Graduate" means you have graduated and no longer need to be subsidize for your survival! There are many better candidates outside, lining up to join our top research program, and if you haven't grown up enough to be independent after 21 to secure you own housing or to drive a car, you don't really deserve a place here in graduate school. Just leave and give the spot to a more mature candidate, then perhaps it is indeed a better Princeton for everyone.|~|4|~|Saturday, March 14, 2015 9:07 AM|~|1906735766|~|NA|~|0
81050|~|absurd logic|~|I guess you could call the stipend that graduate students receive 'generous', but that would be ignoring that the median incoming of the surrounding area is 2-3x that stipend. And yes, Princeton is an expensive area to live in--housing is 2.5-3x more expensive than the nationwide average; and moreover, it is not situated in an area that facilitates off-campus living, as you might see at any peer institution that is in a larger town or city.  These things--the lack of other available housing, the cost of that housing, and the financial compensation that graduate students receive--couple together to place a significant strain on graduate students, many of whom work long hours that are not conducive to using public transit to get back home if that home is far removed from the campus. You also posit that there are many better candidates lining up to join graduate programs--but were that the case, they would be accepted into the graduate programs on their own intellectual merits. Surely you don't think that being in a financial position to independently support yourself through 5+ years of minimal compensation in an expensive region should be a consideration for who is accepted into graduate program? Additionally, many schools *do* provide a vibrant and engaged atmosphere ('campus recreation') for its graduate students, complete with (*gasp*) many social and professional events and space for meeting. To pretend it is appropriate only for undergrads is to elevate undergrads to a bizarrely exalted status and also ignores the reality of how other schools interact with their graduate population.|~|8|~|Saturday, March 14, 2015 12:36 PM|~|1906983900|~|1906735766|~|0

Also, There isn't enough parking to support everyone driving, so that was a really horrible suggestion. We are still paying rent, and the housing is only considered subsidized because of the inflated market value for housing, and not the cost of supplies/labor to build the thing.  I bet the uni would see profit in the long term by doing this.  |~|1|~|Saturday, March 14, 2015 12:36 PM|~|1906984167|~|1906735766|~|0

Undergrads should, and do, benefit from the outstanding quality of Princeton's graduate programs, but graduate seminars are not merely 'advanced studies of the undergraduate curriculum'. Most of these are research seminars, and many are closed to undergraduates exactly because of the emphasis they place on the research component. Undergraduates do get to take part, not because the graduate programs are weak but rather because the undergraduate programs are exceptionally strong. Furthermore, it is common practice for motivated undergraduates to enroll in graduate courses, not just at Princeton, but at all top learning institutions.|~|10|~|Friday, March 13, 2015 9:38 PM|~|1906265987|~|1906118543|~|0

81050|~|GS2|~|How sensible is it to compare the graduate and undergraduate experience provided by the university? Princeton may spend more “community building” attention on undergrads, but we (grad students) aren’t paying $50k/year to be here. The University waives our tuition, gives us health insurance, and pays us a stipend. In terms of feeling like we don’t “belong” or “have community,” grad school is just a very different stage of life—and one, let’s be honest, that does not select for the most effusively outgoing, community-building people. The article is careful not to point fingers or blame anyone for mistreatment, but it (and these comments) heads in that direction—and I find that pretty silly. I’ve been overwhelmed by what Princeton does for its grad students since I’ve gotten here. To list a few: an annual grad student appreciation week, regular High Tables, semesterly Graduate Student Writing Days, a number of free meals at the GC, an end-of-the-year field day, free non-academic classes (like meditation classes), a weekly social hour with an open bar, a very functional transit system, the subsidized DBar, subsidized NYC travel/shows, social events/parties, and on. These relate to both the academic graduate life and to non-academic/social activities, and are so numerous that their advertising emails literally overwhelm my inbox. And the university’s provided housing for 70-80% of the grad student population? That’s pretty good, and at least comparable to peer universities. Probably 10% or so of grad students wouldn’t want to live on campus/in Princeton anyways, so you’ve really accounted for the vast majority of the grad population here. I’m all for an on-campus center. More housing would be great. Those suggestions on their own seem sensible to me. It’s the editorializing of faulting the university for failing to build some graduate-version-of-undergrad land, or the comments implying grad students here are “mistreated,” that seem misguided.|~|1|~|Wednesday, March 18, 2015 6:56 PM|~|1914904935|~|NA|~|0

80929|~|Nice work|~|This is quite good. Good on you, Steve Swanson. I'd go further than that, however. I'd say disparate impact doesn't make much sense in any case, because any selectivity could automatically select for some variation. Say a company only hires from a certain college: the racial makeup of that company's employees will reflect the racial makeup of the college (assuming all else is held equal), unless the company specifically takes steps to avoid that by hiring certain groups out of proportion to their prevalence in the college population. I think it's an excellent point that you make that this is something that should be considered when dealing with aggregate statistics. However, it's not the only thing. If there exists a policy which inadvertently benefits certain groups over others, then I agree with the Supreme Court that it should then be necessary to consider whether it's absolutely necessary to have that policy or its selectivity. For example, certain facets of the tax code inadvertently (and advertently, to be honest) benefit the wealthy. Is that a necessary evil, or is there a way around it? Even if it's a necessary evil to achieve the intended benefit, is the intended benefit worth the inadvertent cost?|~|2|~|Tuesday, March 10, 2015 8:24 PM|~|1900223688|~|NA|~|0
80929|~|ShadrachSmith|~|Steve,  if we seek to apply policies neutrally (i.e. without disparate treatment) to a multicultural society, these policies will cause disparate impacts because of differing cultural attributes; if we want neutral policies to have equal impacts across protected classes, we must stamp out cultural differences; and if we desire equal impacts of policies for a multicultural society, we must give different groups disparate treatment.  Rule of Law people (Justice Thomas or Newby Parton) and Social Justice advocates (eg Justice Ginsburg or Goodwin Liu) have trouble resolving that conflict because current word choice has become overly...colorful. You are providing a morally-neutral vocabulary for the discussion about who deserves a hand up on society's ladder, and who doesn't. You have cleaned up the code. That makes things better.

Regardless of whether her Jewish heritage would have influenced Beyda's choices or not, she is an equal representative of the student body and her opinions are just as valid. That said, to move this conversation to a slightly large framework, I do think there is discussion to be had regarding the balance between political and religious authority when it comes to Jewish politicians, for example. Although I'm sure many people in our government would say their first allegiance is to God, the Jewish people have an added ally in the nation of Israel. By moving an aspect of religious allegiance to the 'mundane' plane, any Jewish person has a balance to strike. Does ultimate loyalty lie with home and country, or with religion and culture? To what extent is this dual citizenship? Hopefully by casting away and fighting the deep-held anti-Semitism found in many parts of the world, we can open up a more logical and progress-minded dialogue.|~|2|~|Tuesday, March 10, 2015 10:41 PM|~|1900397126|~|NA|~|0

First, you absurdly assume that all Jews necessarily "have an added ally in the nation of Israel," as if all Jews profess loyalty to Israel and as if this supposed "dual citizenship" makes them somehow less American or less loyal. Of course, this line of reasoning represents a long-held anti-Semitic canard accusing Jews of dual-loyalty, as was the case with the Dreyfus Affair (which, ironically, convinced Theodor Herzl of the need for a Jewish state- do some research). If your logic, certainly all American Christians possess an "added ally" in every other Christian country in the world, as do American Muslims in all Islamic countries. Likewise, do you think that Americans of Irish/Italian/Chinese descent are guilty of dual loyalty if they retain strong ties to their heritage? Identity is inclusive, not exclusive, and cannot be limited to any one particular attachment. Perhaps next time, before spewing this anti-Semitic garbage, you should examine your own identity and your own "dual citizenships" before castigating others.|~|7|~|Wednesday, March 11, 2015 7:35 PM|~|1902307732|~|1900397126|~|0

The problem is when the opinion starts controlling the way the objective is presented.  People notice certain trends in how the "objective" is (mis)reported, and then test that observation against the editorial history of the publication and come to conclusions that the paper is untrustworthy.    For example; when there is a criminal misuse of a firearm, it bleeds all over the front page.    It is, however, extremely rare that the more frequent occurrence of a lawful self defense use with a gun gets front page-picture laden stories, with interviews of thankful survivors.   Most often, these occurrences get stuck back in the local police blotter section.    It follows that those who may view gun ownership favorably (or are even neutral on the subject), get suspicious,  when the manner events are reported are designed to conform to the political beliefs of the writers or editors.

I agree with your suggestion to "Find the waste. Slash it." -- but this catchy lingo suggests it is much easier said than done, and painting Haneef in such a bad light is frankly unfair. I'm sure if you investigated or asked Dining Services (as I have, for a journalism class) about the waste in the dining halls, you would find that it's very difficult, much more than it is for a restaurant, to judge how many students will be eating that day. The dining halls provide a vast array of foods that might not add up to the exact $17.53, but there's no way that you could eat at a restaurant and potentially eat a hamburger, fries, a bowl of cereal, a banana, access to a salad bar, a main dish, pizza and ice cream with a dessert.

80654|~|161616|~|I generally agree with the author: the price tag is ridiculous, especially when one considers that unlike restaurants, they do not need to pay rent or indeed make profit. But there are two important differences between restaurants and the dining halls that the author has not considered. First, because they cater to a very diverse population, the dining halls need to provide an enormous amount of options (from the many different kinds of milk and cereals through a fully stocked salad bar every lunch and dinner, and then of course the various hot food items). Second, because they cater to the very same people every day, they also need to change their menu every day. Maintaining this diversity (within each meal and between meals) must cost a great deal both in terms of ingredients and in terms of labor. Do these costs justify $18 per all-you-can-eat meal? They probably don't. But they should be considered when we compare dining halls and restaurants. Just one more note: I'm vegetarian, and I shoild say that even though dining hall food is indeed sometimes bland (itself the result of the need to cater to people with different tastes), it is often the best deal for vegetarians in town. There are only a few better options for a healthy and satisfying vegetarian meal if you don't want to cook for yourself. The dining halls do that very well. |~|3|~|Friday, March 6, 2015 6:24 AM|~|1891433028|~|NA|~|0

Furthermore, the university offers meals during fall break, intersession, and spring break to those on unlimited plans. This is on top of providing meals during all of reading period and exams. As someone said below, this comes out to be 33 weeks where you can eat at the dining hall. You keep mentioning that economies of scale should be a factor, but that's not the case- Our dining halls deal with an enormous amount of food waste, offsetting any advantage to serving many people.

You're right that the unlimited meal plan has lower costs if used liberally, but even a student who eats three dining hall meals a day, every day, for the entire school year would pay $12 a meal. Edit: I was mistaken because I did not take into account reading periods and final exam weeks. Below is my original math. This is $6050 / (3 meals x 7 days x 24 weeks). Using your meal plan in this way is not feasible -- only two meals are offered on weekends, for example, and students will occasionally get a meal elsewhere. I used the Block 95 plan for my math because this is a lot of meals -- we would still expect economies of scale to come into play here -- and its limits allow for calculating a definite number.|~|0|~|Friday, March 6, 2015 2:30 PM|~|1892364810|~|1891548045|~|1

For example, a tremendous cost for restaurants in Princeton is their overhead--exorbitant rents, heating, electricity, etc. Dining Services doesn't have to pay for any of that. The University also benefits from tremendous economies of scale and has far fewer employees to patrons than most commercial restaurants, so personnel costs (even if the University is paying workers a good wage) can't really explain the high pricing. Also, even though many students are on unlimited or Block 235, we shouldn't assume that most students are making the most of those swipes--on unlimited last year I used ~200 swipes a semester, meaning that I spent around $15 per meal.

You are at an elite university to learn that the highest social good is that everything should be run by a unionized bureaucracy for the benefit of the least advantaged class. And here you are using utilitarian metrics to judge the product of food workers. That is free-market logic. The Social Justice logic is to look at it from the position of the least advantaged food worker. What difference does cold food really make when compared to the higher moral good of empowering the lowest class of person involved in the means of producing meals?|~|0|~|Sunday, March 8, 2015 11:40 AM|~|1895044830|~|1893729648|~|1

Sorry to be pointed, but did you actually do any background research before spouting off about this? It sure doesn't seem so.

While the meat at Hunan is often very suspect, and our dining halls will presumably pay more in labor costs (e.g. student jobs that aren't strictly necessary from a business perspective, but are very important to financial aid plans), people should wonder how the university manages to charge fully TWICE what Hunan does for food of a (let's be generous) similar quality|~|0|~|Thursday, March 5, 2015 11:33 PM|~|1891101467|~|NA|~|0

(His family runs one, and he's worked there his whole life.) He is very positive about the conditions and is quite sure that profitable restaurants make more than enough to pay workers well -- whether they pay up or keep the profits is up to the owner. Recall that Hunan is just one of many comparison points in my column. Surely Yale, whose dining halls charge 36% less than ours, pays its workers a living wage.|~|1|~|Thursday, March 5, 2015 9:55 PM|~|1891009643|~|1890984280|~|1

80663|~|Grad student|~|The issue is not what career path you choose, but the reasons that you choose it for. At the end of the day when you're looking for your next step you need to set your priorities straight and make sure that you're true to them. Is your priority to make money fast because you want to pay your student loans or help support your family or just because that's your goal in life? Then high-paying jobs are an obvious choice. Also, as you mention, there are people who are following their passion by going into the finance and consulting sectors, and for them it's likely the job description that they're choosing and not just the paycheck (although of course, the paycheck is no drawback). There's also the case of people who try to look for jobs in the fields that they are passionate about but just can't get them for any number of reasons. By the time June and July come, many seniors might be desperate to take any job since their priorities might have shifted (e.g. be able to pay rent). Finally, there's the group of people who go into finance and consulting jobs because they don't want to go through the trouble or lack of security of following their actual dreams. If you have the privilege, as you say, of following your dreams because you don't have a student loan to pay or a family to maintain, then I think it's a waste of that privilege and a betrayal to yourself to not have the courage to pursue your passions. I have friends from college who fit all of the categories mentioned above, and I can tell you that 3 years out, most of my friends who initially signed with Goldman Sachs or IBM quit within one or two years because they could not stand it (not the pressure but the job itself). They are now working for start-ups and other fields they enjoy more. Conversely, my friends who felt passionately about their finance and consulting jobs have gotten promoted and are loving it. Being able to follow your dreams is probably one of the biggest privileges anyone can ever have. So if you're one of the lucky ones, don't waste it and don't be embarrassed by it.|~|1|~|Saturday, March 7, 2015 5:57 PM|~|1894254694|~|NA|~|0

I wouldn't necessarily say that doing finance is easy, but I do think it's an easy option to select.

Perhaps it's indicative of the remarkable myopia with which Princeton students tend to look at this decision. There's a huge spectrum of job opportunities (even within finance). Tech makes for a useful example, where you could join anything from your own startup to a mid-sized company (~10-100 employees) to a multinational corporation (GOOG, MSFT, FB, etc.).

Well, it's because we almost all have more than one way of gaining finance stability and career advancement.

And some of these ways are more in line with 1. helping others (somehow) and 2. our interests than others are.  But they often get pushed out by the desire for money and prestige.  And that's what's driving this machine. I don't want to talk about any one individual (I'm certainly not going to disparage Jimmy right after he tells me he's in consulting when I meet him), but look at the percentage of people who go into finance and consulting.

80663|~|'07|~|This is a great piece - compliments to the writer. One element she alludes to, that bears repeating: when people talk about income inequality and the role of universities like Princeton in helping to level this playing field, this is what they mean. When I started in consulting coming out of Princeton, I was instantly making more money than anyone in my family ever had. Princeton students who grew up with parents making six figures (or more) probably don't appreciate what it feels like to not have the security that Tehila describes. And if you think working for profits is inherently bad, you need to revisit the history of the past 200 years. It doesn't hurt, by the way, that the job of consulting is indeed intellectually stimulating and really does help people and the broader economy in unambiguously positive ways (can't always say the same for most roles in finance). And consulting for the world's largest organizations gives you the scale to have far greater positive impact on the world than some ill-conceived attempt at saving the world on your own.|~|0|~|Friday, March 6, 2015 8:28 PM|~|1892904537|~|NA|~|1

80663|~|Guest|~|You made some good points, but I'd like question that consulting is a "secure, respectable, intellectually challenging career."  Many consulting gigs push out the majority of their analysts after two years of work.  It's true that they often go to other high-paying jobs, but changing one's life so soon is hardly stable.  Also, a lot of consulting involves running excel spreadsheets and creating PowerPoints designed to explain how to maximize profit.  This can be quite tiring and repetitive, and the ways of maximizing profit can involve strategies like layoffs, which hurt workers.  So the work isn't always respectable and intellectually challenging. Your article also presents a dichotomy of consulting/finance-type jobs vs art/activism-type jobs.  This dichotomy is a common illusion on campus, but it's just an illusion.  Try joining the armed forces, or the foreign service.  Try joining the public works department of a town or city and trying to become town manager/mayor.  Study for an engineering degree, then join a firm that designs things that help people.  In jobs like these, you can find truly secure, respectable, and challenging work.|~|0|~|Thursday, March 5, 2015 8:40 PM|~|1890915882|~|NA|~|0
80663|~|anti-guest|~|You have a very narrow and poorly-informed view of the consulting profession. As an actual management consultant with many years of experience, I can assure you that "repetitive" is not a suitable adjective to describe the profession. If anything, the opposite is true as we’re confronted by a constantly-changing economy and client challenges. Additionally, you object to the possibility that layoffs might be an outcome of a consultant's work. Certainly that is a possible outcome – that’s sometimes what you have to do to keep a business going and it won’t go away just because you stick your head in the sand. Very little of my project work has led to layoffs anyhow - one could also do work on product design, customer segmentation, pricing, improving customer experience etc. What this means is that a consultant can get a very broad view of how to improve organizations – it’s an incredible education and a great start for someone wanting to do just about anything. You might scoff at this, but I’d argue that the skills learned via even a few years of consulting would make you better at many of the jobs you listed on your approved list of suitable careers. You also hint that consulting cannot "help people" as one can do in other careers such as the armed forces (where you might shoot people while you’re in the process of helping, just FYI). I think your definition of “help” is overly narrow. Right now I am helping a client expand into a new market with a new product and service proposition. If we pull it off, it will employ many people, it will give clients something that they value and don’t currently have, shareholders like pension funds and endowments will make money… how isn’t this “help”?|~|0|~|Friday, March 6, 2015 5:10 PM|~|1892649154|~|1890915882|~|0

80571|~|Astronaut Steven R. Swanson|~|What is the point of this column? It sounds like you're telling your readers that holding a strong opinion and expressing it when not explicitly invited is an indecorous overreaction. Expression isn't limited to purely logical rhetoric. One doesn't have to formulate a perfect and irrefutable argument to attack a political position. I don't need any reason at all to agree or disagree with something, and to express that whenever I want. On the surface your argument seems to come from a reasonable place, but that's exactly what makes it subversive and even sinister. You provide examples of both "liberal" and "conservative" stereotyping in American political discourse in what appears to be an attempt to make an apolitical argument that rises above petty partisanship, but the sense of social order you invoke when you appeal to "unbiased reason" is already a highly politically charged construct. To put it bluntly, it's associated with rightist ideology. Even the names of right-wing political movements are telling of this connection: consider "Objectivism." Rejecting arguments that come from "mere feeling," or dismissing "extreme" courses of action as overreaction is a tactic often used by reactionaries and the libertarian right. Perhaps you wouldn't deny, though, that your own biases (which you admit to having, as you describe them as "universal") motivate your negative feeling toward the type of discussion you decry in your column.|~|0|~|Wednesday, March 4, 2015 11:39 PM|~|1888519970|~|NA|~|0
80571|~|Steve Swanson '15|~|I challenge you to attach your real name to these comments: clearly you do have an opinion you find worthy of detailed expression on this issue, so why hide behind anonymity? Further, the pseudonym that you chose leads me to believe that you may be someone I know personally. On to your point: I categorically disagree with your paraphrase of the column's argument. Nowhere did I say that "holding a strong opinion and expressing it when not explicitly invited is an indecorous overreaction"; rather, I pointed out that these examples of vitriolic rhetoric were not only indecorous, but based on an incorrect perception of the facts. However, the reason that this merits reply is that actually do support the strawman that you attack here. Though I never used the words "unbiased reason," despite the fact that you put them in quotes, I admit that I believe that political discourse should be motivated mostly by reason, and should be as free of irrational bias as possible. While it's true that you "don't need any reason at all to agree or disagree with something," if you aren't basing things on reason, what are you basing them on? I'm fully aware of the Humean idea that "reason is the slave of the passions," but this is a two-way street: reason determines the best way to implement the goals set out by irrational emotion. Beyond the philosophical argument for reason, I'll mention that arguments fueled by "mere feeling" don't tend to be very effective. If you aren't giving people a reason to believe what you believe, you won't convince them of your cause. If only because of the efficacy of rationality, I exhort everyone to base most of their arguments on fact and reason. Finally, I take issue with the idea that only the political right invokes unbiased reason. Your only evidence for this assertion is the name of Rand's "Objectivism," which I'll admit claims to be a rational system. However, you neglect the even more aptly named "Rationalist" movement, adherents of which are usually secular utilitarians and political leftists. For every libertarian claiming that the nonaggression principle is a product of pure reason there's a liberal claiming the same for the universal right to healthcare; for every leftist appealing to emotion to argue for affirmative action there's a conservative appealing to religious sentiment to argue for traditionalist social policy. No side has a monopoly on claims of rationality or appeals to the passions.|~|1|~|Thursday, March 5, 2015 9:58 AM|~|1889339883|~|1888519970|~|1

Seriously though, I rely on structure to get things done that I'd otherwise not even consider, especially things that do not bring immediate benefits, e.g. working a tedious job for a paycheck, boring readings for an otherwise cool class etc. As for relationships, I have learned at Princeton that structure is more important than I once thought. People do drift apart once they have no structured activities connecting them on a daily basis (e.g. sports, dance groups etc.). It is a painful and true fact. Many people on campus would rather be out and about doing stuff rather than just chilling and doing nothing (the type A personalities etc.), and the only way to meet such people would be to do stuff along with them. I have a close friend who is so much fun to be around, but I have noticed that she just cannot sit down and chill and do nothing but talk. We connect over movies and night-time chats...which only happen after a movie ends.|~|1|~|Friday, March 6, 2015 4:39 PM|~|1892600676|~|NA|~|0

When Stanford divested from coal, the stock prices of affected companies fell disproportionately, because other investors saw it as a signal that coal companies were going to take big hits from the burgeoning divestment movement. When you're an investor, you can't just think about how the company is going to perform; you also have to try to predict how other investors will behave. The weight of Princeton's name in contributing to this phenomenon of downward spiral from a broad sustainable investment movement can scarcely be exaggerated.

Do we only invest in funds that don't make direct investments in specific areas, or arrange with willing funds to join in all their investments except the ones we find objectionable? Even if we assume that there are other investments that are equal to or better than fossil fuels (etc.) on a risk adjusted basis, wouldn't this rule have a significant impact on returns by way of our choice of funds?

80108|~|2015|~|Well, that's exactly the point, which the Ed Board seems incapable of understanding (or did not bother to read). PSII is not a call for divestment. It is a means to set up the long term investment guidelines to shift our endowment's allocation in a reasonable way, taking into account things like pooled investment funds. And fossil fuels aren't a wildly more profitable industry than others. At worst, we're talking about marginal declines in returns on a small fraction of the endowment in the short term, with probable better returns in the long run assuming stranded assets (i.e. that fossil fuel companies are prevented at one point from completely destabilizing the climate).|~|1|~|Monday, March 2, 2015 4:48 PM|~|1884101413|~|1883977964|~|0

79981|~|DS '14|~|When I began as a freshman at Princeton, I automatically assumed libraries were open 24 hours. I have no idea where this assumption originated, but I quickly found out it was incorrect. I wanted Firestone to be open longer than it was. Now a few years later, I actually believe students can get by fine with the study spaces provided. It would be unnecessarily expensive to maintain 24 hr access to Firestone and I wonder how many people would try to move in. One thing that would be nice is if the different desks in Firestone were open as long as the library itself.|~|0|~|Sunday, March 1, 2015 8:57 AM|~|1881857000|~|NA|~|0
79844|~|'14|~|The author has it backwards. We join eating clubs not because they are some integral part of the Princeton experience; we join because they provide a necessary break from that experience. Princeton is, at its core, a challenging environment. Princeton challenges us to befriend randomly-assigned roommates and navigate a residential setup where people who live close to one another might struggle to connect. Princeton challenges us to complete tough, time-consuming assignments week in and week out. Princeton challenges us to explore all its vast opportunities and also to commit wholly to our interests. With all the stuff that Princeton puts on our plates, it's nice to sit down and breathe for a minute sometimes. At the clubs, we don't have to worry about eating alone because the dining hall is full of unfamiliar faces. We can grab dinner, shoot pool, take a nap, and watch movies on demand without having to walk more than a minute to get from one spot to the next. Or if we need to work, we can escape the isolation of a dorm room and the rules of a campus library. We can jam out to loud music and not have our neighbors call P-Safe on us. We can get coffee and beer in the same place. We can surround ourselves with people who choose us. When Princeton is work, eating clubs are home. If it weren't for maroon and forest green and navy blue and whatever the hell colors Terrace kids are wearing these days, we'd all get sick of orange and black. Long live the clubs.|~|30|~|Thursday, February 26, 2015 12:33 AM|~|1876122889|~|NA|~|0

79844|~|ex-club officer|~|An overall great read with a few problematic assumptions/misdirects 1. Assuming that bicker acceptance rates are set arbitrarily/purely to propagate exclusivity is straight up wrong for certain clubs. An operating cap is set by ALL clubs based on discussions with club management, grad boards, and kitchen staffs; that's why you see sign-in clubs like Terrace FILLING in the first round (and occasionally accidentally over-enrolling and encouraging their overflow members to sign in elsewhere, a la spring 2014). Some bicker clubs admit classes equal to that actual operational cap; some, it seems, don't. Point is, the numbers are not always arbitrary, and the University over-admit analogy doesn't hold; an individual club simply does not have the physical space or resource pool to scale up or down to accommodate large over-enrolled classes, whereas the University does. 2. A big missed point on club finances - EVERY eating club is more expensive than any comparable "alternative" option by far (unless your definition of "going independent" is eating at Mediterra 2x a day, or you joined Quad in that brief glorious period in which it matched the cost of the unlimited d-hall plan). For many non-club members (though certainly not all - no disrespect intended either way), the decision to not join a club is heavily, heavily influenced by the financials and not through a more objective consideration of "which social structure do I want".  So long as every club is more expensive then University or independent options, the system is exclusionary by default, and that's a big problem that clubs and the university need to address - and yet, to the best of my knowledge, not a single club offers financial aid to members who need help covering the costs of joining.|~|8|~|Wednesday, February 25, 2015 11:40 PM|~|1876078076|~|NA|~|0
79844|~|Steve Swanson '15|~|Clubs that do offer financial aid often don't advertise it because it is necessarily on an individualized basis.

79844|~|or you don't |~|Below is my response to you, using my interpretation of the article (so apologies to Avaneesh if I misinterpret): He's not saying that people don't find eating club experiences to be good; he's asking about why people joined in the first place, and suggesting that for some (or many) other people, it's only because "it's the thing to do" and not for any other particular reason. He's asking that you THINK about WHY you get involved with clubs, not saying that the ONLY reason is "because it's what we do." His closing statement is literally just "think carefully" about ANY decision you make to do with dining (independent or eating club), not stating one is definitively better than the other. Yeah, duh, Avaneesh clearly thinks bicker is not a good thing, but he's not saying no one ever has had a good experience with Princeton eating clubs, just that a lot of people haven't, and we should maybe think and care about that fact. To act as though he's not open to discussion or conversation in your comment is rude and, frankly, wrong. Yeah he's got an opinion. he's allowed an opinion. But his call to action isn't "LETS THROW OUT BICKER FOR SURE RIGHT NOW IT SUCKS IM RIGHT YOURE WRONG" it's "I think this is a bad thing, and I think we should all think about it and discuss it further and if that discussion proves me right, do something about it" Basically, what I'm saying is don't be a lazy self-righteous dick. If you've got reasons, post them. For god sakes let's have a discussion. Writing a comment on a forum like this isn't JUST for giving feedback to the author. There are other people here too. Do you not care about how they interpret this issue? Do you not want to engage them? If you disagree with him so strongly, do you really want this article sitting here, without your own opposing view being expressed faithfully for people to read after they have read the article?|~|22|~|Wednesday, February 25, 2015 11:39 PM|~|1876077396|~|1876048987|~|0

79644|~|Steve Swanson '15|~|I think that the main issue that people have with the "Hose Bicker" referendum and its supporters is they neglect to demonstrate why Bicker is not just harmful, but so harmful that we ought to use University power to dismantle it. Joe here points to the "inherent role of social rejection in the Bicker process," rightly targeting this as a negative aspect of the Bicker process, but doesn't explain why this particular ill should be righted by the University. While he asserts that "the responsibility of dismissing this rejection should not be placed on hosed students," he neither defends this assertion (why should the people voluntarily entering into a system not bear its consequences?) nor explains why the proper response to this is banning Bicker. The rest of the column, much like almost all of the content on  hosebicker.tumblr.com , merely challenges the efficacy of Bicker and points out the benefits of alternative system. None of this is relevant, though, if the necessity for the imposition of University power is not established: the question is not "do we find Bicker to be the optimal system," but "ought we impose our will on others to prevent them using Bicker in their own clubs?" To me, the second question is much more difficult to support than the first, yet has almost no space devoted to it either on the site or in this column. A simple majority of undergraduates deciding that Bicker is not the perfect club admissions system is not sufficient cause to justify using legalistic referenda to police the behavior of others.|~|36|~|Tuesday, February 24, 2015 10:00 PM|~|1874054250|~|NA|~|1

You cannot expect private institutions to bend to the will of a simple majority of the undergraduate student body without some threat of force by the university, whether it be defunding, removal of quasi-recognition (i.e. puwireless, printer clusters, etc.) or suspending student for affiliation with an eating club that refuses to end Bicker (as they did with the frats).

79644|~|terrace '16|~|I think both this article and the Hose Bicker campaign are missing the point. Bicker clubs are independent institutions that have no obligation to potential members. That is the bottom line. They get to choose the members that they believe are best fit for the club. People bicker BECAUSE they are exclusive clubs--do you really think that, for example, Cottage would still exist if everyone could get into it? While self-selection is already at work, many people do not bicker because they know that they would not get in. If UCC ran as a sign-in (or points system or ironclad or whatever), their club culture would fundamentally change. While I do not particularly enjoy hanging out at UCC, they have the right to maintain their club culture as best they see fit. Granted, I do think bicker is a stupid and sometimes arbitrary system… that's why I didn't bicker.|~|33|~|Tuesday, February 24, 2015 10:09 PM|~|1874064108|~|NA|~|0
79644|~|Guest '16|~|The ironclad system is a terrible idea. 1) As mentioned above it would lead to stronger affiliations and factionalism within clubs as all the (for example) soccer guys are guaranteed to end up in the same club 2) The system would be incredibly exclusive on a much more personal level. At least with bicker if you get hosed, you know your friends fought for you but couldnt sway strangers. Your friends making plans to join clubs without you would hurt on a really deep level. Similarly, what if you didn't have as many points as your friends? It puts them in a terrible position to decide if baggaging with you is worth having a lower chance of getting in. 3) Many upperclassmen join eating clubs to MAKE friends. If ironclad became the norm, then you would automatically be outside the norm for wanting to join an eating club by yourself, and could be excluded as everyone else would have joined with their friends.|~|32|~|Tuesday, February 24, 2015 10:31 PM|~|1874091309|~|NA|~|0

79644|~|'14|~|The only possible family of systems that does not cause a feeling of social rejection among hosed students is a lottery. If the members of the club have any quantitative input whatsoever into determining the club membership allocation among the bickerees, then those who are not admitted have been rejected by people, not a computer. Any system that requires attendance at events to ensure admittance disadvantages students with high workloads and significant extracurricular commitments during the fall semester. It would be a shame if students' non-social obligations harmed them quantitatively in the club selection process; club memberships should not necessarily be awarded to whoever has the most free time to rack up points at events during the fall. It would also be a shame if the members of a club, who pay thousands of dollars per semester for membership, had some of their favorite applicants turned away because a computer said so. It would also also be a shame if applicants whom the current members believe would make fantastic new members but who didn't consider applying to that club until January were turned away because a computer said so. It would also also also be a shame a club were forced to take an applicant who poses a clear threat to the physical or emotional safety of that club or its members because a computer said so. (I can't understand why anyone wants a lottery in the first place. Had I been admitted to a high-demand club via lottery, I would have taken a long time for me to shake the feeling that the people in my club didn't really want me there.) Ironclads necessitate even more drama than room draw group selection, and they have a more lasting impact. They also lend themselves to clubs full of cliques, and a club full of cliques does not sound appealing. Of course club membership allocation be improved. I just haven't heard a good way to do so without leaving bicker mostly in place. Again, I propose that the open clubs return to the bicker process, and maybe they should start using passes as well. If clubs want to accept all members who bicker, then that's wonderful. If clubs want to hand out thirty passes per member per night so that pretty much anyone can get in, that's fantastic. (Perhaps the best way to destroy the ridiculous but commonly-held notion that current sign-in clubs are inferior to current bicker clubs is to require everyone to make friends in each club in order to complete a Prospect 10/11/12/whatever. It constitutes progress if new freshmen don't see as stark a difference in social value between Ivy members and Charter members as students have in the past.) On the other hand, if a club wants to admit the bickerees they like best and limit the number of people who get free beer from its taps, that's cool, too.|~|13|~|Tuesday, February 24, 2015 11:40 PM|~|1874165911|~|NA|~|0

Similarly many of the clubs have events for sophomores throughout the semester, granted, they could be made more inclusive, but these offer opportunities to meet members and not just through bicker week.

79644|~|Jay Squiers|~|In the early 1980's, there were 8 open clubs -- Campus, Dial, Terrace, Colonial, Quad, Elm, Charter and Cloister and 5 Bicker Clubs.  Today, there are 5 open clubs, one points club and 6 Bicker Clubs.  For those of you looking to end Bicker, please consider why the Bicker Clubs continue to thrive with significant capital improvements and why 4 of the open clubs have disappeared?  Nothing prohibits the open clubs from raising money and keeping up the selective clubs, other than the loyalty of their alums or the lack thereof.|~|0|~|Monday, March 2, 2015 4:11 PM|~|1884038400|~|NA|~|0

79516|~|Steve Swanson '15|~|Thanks for your response. Yes, I do mention possibly offering classes as part of a way to mitigate the lack of knowledge caused by coddling. However, this is the least of three suggestions, the other two being to 1) restructure Housing and Dining to be more like the options available in the real world and 2) more generally try to change the way we see ourselves and the way the faculty see us. I will be the first to concede that neither of these is particularly compelling as a rallying cry, but this doesn't seem to be a problem that admits of an easy solution: short of radically changing the University, a general awareness and slight lessening of the coddling is to my mind the best we can hope for.|~|9|~|Monday, February 23, 2015 9:29 PM|~|1871940107|~|1871882705|~|1

79516|~|Grown-up tiger|~|This is... cute.  Sure, there's a ton of real-life experience I lacked when I graduated from Princeton.  At the same time, fixing all the things that break in my abode and keeping it clean while spending an hour a day making food, not to mention constant financial decisions including apartments and cars and career negotiations, would have been a distraction from the whole purpose of going to Princeton.  Not sure how this domestic minutia are more important than coursework and being a part of all the amazing things that happen on Princeton's campus on a regular basis.  There's a time for everything, and college is not the time for household maintenance.  Professionals who work 50+ hours/week or are in night school for their master's eat a lot of takeout and tend to hire people to handle things instead of DIY. Is this "coddling," or just acting in line with their priorities? So.  The real world.  You'll get there, and when the time comes, experience will teach you.  It will not be comfortable.  Do you really want the harsh lessons *now*?  I'd hope that the same critical thinking skills you apply to academics would keep you out of the worst of them...|~|6|~|Tuesday, February 24, 2015 11:49 AM|~|1872915683|~|NA|~|0

There's just not much real world experience you can get here. You can walk around late at night no matter who you are, finding a job is easy, and everything's expensive but nice. The only way to get that real world experience is to fuck up renting an apartment for a summer or to live in a nastier place. On a side note, don't use comprised of. It's bad English.

79516|~|PSJ|~|I'm confused by your claims of "coddling" on the part of the university. Is it more patronizing to assume that these adult students will be able to navigate basic life experiences on their own or to provide classes on every minutia of daily life? Perhaps the university should issue an announcement reminding students that our skills in researching academics can also be applied to learning things in the "real world."|~|3|~|Monday, February 23, 2015 8:52 PM|~|1871892747|~|NA|~|1
79516|~|Student|~|Thanks for your thoughts, it's interesting to see a new perspective on this. However, I may say that I would be opposed to any major change in philosophy in regards to housing. While we may not be gaining practical life skills, there is something to be said for the social and intellectual development spawned by living, eating and studying constantly around other individuals on the same campus, in shared buildings and spaces. If you read Andrew Delbanco's "College," he describes the importance of lateral learning and the role a residential community plays in fostering less obvious skills that ultimately result in more well rounded adults. While I doubt you're suggesting mass exodus to off campus housing, I am hesitant to support a shift toward greater independent alternatives at a university whose distinctiveness is partly derived from the community fostered on our grounds and within the structures currently set in place. Just my two cents!|~|1|~|Monday, February 23, 2015 11:18 PM|~|1872065583|~|NA|~|0

Like this paragraph:  "And there is no room for the politically disinterested yet aware — those who remain cognizant of political news but simply aren’t as invested in political affairs as many others on campus. These individuals may not side with one particular party or side, or they may not care enough to commit to one side’s philosophy. Or perhaps they simply don’t have fully formulated political views. After all, according to a survey conducted by “Reason” magazine on 2000 Millennials (aged 18 to 29), our generation’s views are totally incoherent and constantly evolving." So... there's no room for millenials? Or are these dichotomies inconstant? How can there be a dichotomy, but no room for the far left, far right, or center? Are you just saying that people who don't participate in politics aren't participating? Sarah, what do you mean????|~|5|~|Tuesday, February 24, 2015 12:19 AM|~|1872119438|~|NA|~|0

79513|~|WC '17|~|Your use of the Whig-Clio debate as an example of this ostensibly negative trend demonstrates this piece's silliness.  Such debates, which bring together people with opposing views for respectful discussion, are exactly the type of opportunity we should be sponsoring on campus. Of course people are going to vote for one side or the other! That's the point of a debate. And of course some of the participants will come in with established perspectives - you, as one of Whig's main speakers, certainly did.  But people still learn and change their minds over the course of a debate; in fact, I overheard one student who normally votes Whig switch his vote to Clio after finding Clio's arguments more convincing.  Ultimately, the nature of politics is that a decision must eventually be made to pursue a certain policy. That requires tough and sometimes divisive choices to be made.  While this can and should be done respectfully, you need to accept the inherent division in politics as the nature of the beast.|~|4|~|Monday, February 23, 2015 11:30 PM|~|1872076868|~|NA|~|0

79513|~|WC '17|~|1) I disagree with your assessment Andrew details the debates. And since he wasn't even at the religion debate you mentioned or this most recent debate Sarah referenced in your article, his actions are largely irrelevant to the broader idea that Whig-Clio and any sort of "two-party" grouping offers opportunities for people to hear different ideas rather than interact only echo chamber groups like College Reps/Dems. 2) Of course whichever side has more people wins. Again, the idea of democracy and politics is that the majority present/voting wins the argument and implements its policy. But frankly the results of the WC debate motions don't really matter. What matters is that people are still being exposed to other ideas and learning. Sometimes they may change their views; sometimes they may not. But they've still definitely had their ideas challenged. |~|2|~|Tuesday, February 24, 2015 3:14 AM|~|1872259966|~|1872081222|~|0

79332|~|Nice editorial, but....|~|This is one of my favorite editorials that the Daily Princetonian has ever published. The problem that it addresses is extremely prevalent on campus and should be fixed, namely a lack of political diversity in the speakers that come to Princeton. However, some of the editorial's facts seem to be incorrect. First, the College Republicans did not keep other people in the audience from asking Secretary Sebelius questions (I know this because I was not affiliated with College Republicans but I had my question answered). Just because College Republicans were the most anxious to ask questions and got to the front of the line for microphones did not prevent other people from getting their questions answered. To her credit, Secretary Sebelius actually answered almost everyone's questions. If I remember correctly, there were only one or two people who were still in line and kept from asking a question, and at least one of those people was a College Republican- I assume because they were wearing a College Republican t-shirt. Second, the same is true for the Willie Parker talk. Plenty pro-life students were able to ask questions, and pro-choice students by no means monopolized the Q & A time. Third, the author identifies an important problem- a lack of diversity in the speakers invited to talk at Princeton- and proposes a great solution for how to fix this problem- more panel discussions.  However, the second recommendation in this article does not seem to relate. This is partly because of the points made above. But I also fail to grasp what is wrong with College Republicans being the primary questioners of a figure like Secretary Sebelius or what is wrong with having liberal students being the primary questioners of Ted Cruz or another conservative figure. If the University fails to host a panel discussion and only invites one partisan speaker to give a lecture, then arguably the only way to facilitate diversity of thought (which is supposedly the point of this editorial) is for opposing students to question the speaker. With this in mind, it seems that the College Republicans' questions- which were not "confrontational" at all- accomplished the goal of this editorial rather than detracted from it.|~|9|~|Sunday, February 22, 2015 10:06 PM|~|1870115901|~|NA|~|0

The clubs (for example, Terrace) right now benefit from people who would endorse their club culture (in this example, open-mindedness/liking good music/being chill). That would not be the case under the lottery. If bicker is indeed hosed, sign in clubs would now not only have people who like the flexibility and openness of the sign-in process, but also the people who would be inclined towards exclusivity would be drawn in through the random lottery as well. I feel like the arguments against bicker forget this important detail, and discredit the experiences of those who really want to be in sign-in clubs (who never considered bickering anyway), and threatens the quality of their experience.|~|28|~|Sunday, February 22, 2015 10:20 PM|~|1870131708|~|NA|~|0

No form of rejection after college has affected me quite the same way that knowing that over 150 of my peers listened to people make fun of me behind my back and kept me out of their organization. That is not a company saying that they aren't hiring you because you don't have the grades, proper qualifications, or an internal reference. That is some straight up Mean Girls stuff. Let's not try to sugarcoat what goes on in bicker discussions and how meanspirited and petty they are. For people required to take an ethics class for a graduation requirement, I've never met less compassionate people in my life than most of my Princeton classmates. The same people who will gleefully hose a fellow student and then claim "first world problems" when that hosed student complains after the fact will harp in their Woody Woo thesis about injustice in the developing world.

It may be logistically a little more complicated and it doesn't solve every problem, but by having clubs "bid" on you (and maybe some sort of a guarantee that at least one club will "bid", or an algorithm that places you in one of your top 3/4/5 clubs or something), the rejection issue may be attenuated - of course, this does not address the underlying issue of basing self-worth on a limited external perspective, but it may right some wrongs.

It is selling in the current system because you choose where you bicker and thus much be a club that people want to bicker. Guaranteeing that a club must accept is actually a little hurtful because it takes away your choice and there would inevitably be a "reject club" or a class of people in an eating club that would be considered taken just because they "had to".|~|0|~|Sunday, February 22, 2015 10:35 PM|~|1870149623|~|1870123858|~|0

For any male (Cottage, Ivy & Tiger were still single sex) who could make appearances every night at all five clubs, a membership was guaranteed. If none of the clubs offered membership, the five clubs names were placed in a hat and the club drawn out of the hat had to give a bid to the applicant. Of course, Bicker was wet back then thanks to a drinking age of 18 and making all 5 clubs was a real challenge.|~|0|~|Monday, March 2, 2015 4:20 PM|~|1884054285|~|1870944138|~|1

79162|~|Bennett McIntosh|~|Having written as a columnist under three boards, I can say that's never been a rule - the rule is that columns have to be of interest to Princeton students. A more subjective standard, so occasionally the line is crossed, but I think the pages are better for being able to leave the bubble occasionally. I disagree with Zach on many points (he and I have exchanged words publicly on these very pages) but I respect his conviction and perspective. This is because he, as you say, speaks out. Like it or not, universities are overwhelmingly liberal, and Princeton is only partially an exception - so it's no surprise the Prince skews left. But any student who wishes to apply to the Prince can do so - applications are judged based on quality and relevance, not politics - and we're always willing to accept letters to the editor and guest columns. The entire staff of the paper turns over every four years - if you want to improve the Prince, there is literally nothing standing in your way. |~|7|~|Friday, February 20, 2015 9:05 PM|~|1867075146|~|1865043067|~|1

79162|~|Honesty > Comfort|~|First of all, I think the article was fairly balanced, but whatever. I doubt it mattered to you, Zach Horton. I'm sure the moment you saw his name, you got off your farcically regressive high horse to angrily type out this op-ed. Yes, you believe abortion is murder. But guess what: Most people, including the Supreme Court, don't, because it isn't! What if instead of arguing for "balance," you argued for truthfulness, or questioned your own views? Not every issue has two equally valid sides. That includes this one. Willie Parker is under attack by conservative fanatics such as the amazingly-at-Princeton Zach Horton for working at the only abortion clinic left in Mississippi, a state trying to unconstitutionally (and unethically) ban abortion. News flash: Abortion is legal, and has been for decades! On top of that, Parker faces death threats from rabid pro-lifers (can you say "hypocrisy?") and more than one of his predecessors have been murdered. Really what Jesus Christ would have wanted. His ministry was all about assassinating people based on political views. I also find it incredibly ironic that the author of this op-ed complains frequently--in print, in person, and on social media--about liberal people without any effort toward balance or understanding. You clearly believe you're right, and that's great. Shout it to the mountains! All your hear is your own idiotic words bounced back at you, and then maybe when you're done you'll take the time to write another op-ed that reads, "It's 2015, Roe v. Wade was decided upon by a relatively conservative supreme court in ~1973~ and maybe I only believe this bull because my close-minded, imbalanced, laughably non-journalistic Fox News feeds drivel to me every day."|~|3|~|Saturday, February 21, 2015 4:41 PM|~|1868291014|~|NA|~|0

If that not enough proof, out of the 4 top 10 students at my school, no one got into UPenn. So that means that none of the 4 top 10 students had the extra-curriculars, essay, or recommendations that matched the Peruvian kid which is equal to the chances that the world will explode right now...

78588|~|Steve Swanson '15|~|The "Cool Whip Microaggression" column is one of the most widely misunderstood pieces I'm aware of. The point of that column was not that Newby has been oppressed due to his accent, but that his experience being inadvertently insulted clued him into the way that others must feel in similar situations. He explains how he attained some degree of empathy and exhorts others to be aware of the power that their words have -- a worthy goal. Now, I don't agree with the central point of the Cool Whip column just as I don't agree with this one, but I think that they both deserve a charitable reading, serious reflection, and a well-thought-out response -- not a cursory skim, gut reaction, and vitriolic, ad hominem rebuke. Further, it's true that other newspapers have covered the issue of race and college admissions, but this is an issue that does disproportionately affect the Princeton campus -- hence belongs in our campus paper. The point is that race-based admissions is something that matters to us as more than an abstract debate. You still haven't explained exactly how the "language is unclear" and the "sentences display ignorance." Again, I would urge you to explain why you find these things to be the case, not just that you do if you have any interest in really having a constructive dialogue.|~|16|~|Tuesday, February 17, 2015 11:10 AM|~|1860011957|~|1859974619|~|1

What I find more deeply troubling about your column, however, is that you say that you want to create race-blind admissions in order to benefit Hispanic and African Americans. There's a logical contradiction here - how can you simultaneously acknowledge that the lack of racial diversity is a problem while simultaneously striving to abolish race-based preferences in admissions? California abolished race-based preferences with Proposition 209, after which enrollment by underrepresented minorities like African and Hispanic Americans fell precipitously.|~|15|~|Monday, February 16, 2015 9:01 PM|~|1859157676|~|NA|~|1

78588|~|'15|~|As a first-generation Asian American student here who is on almost full financial aid, I take offense to this poorly written article. Even if an unofficial "quota" existed on Asians, or any other race, for that matter, it does not exist solely for the purpose of excluding a particular racial category. No, indeed, it serves to increase the diversity of the student body in such a way that is conducive to learning from each other. I would not feel more comfortable or any enrichment from finding myself in an environment with majority Asians. I believe that a mix of white, Asian, black, Hispanic, all races is conducive to cross-cultural understanding and learning. Such a mix may not be representative of a merit-based distribution or of the demographics of the U.S. population as a whole. But such a mix does give us the opportunities to learn from each other that we otherwise may not have - I don't need to converse with my Asian friends about Asian delicacies because we are all familiar with them. But I find it extremely intriguing to talk about Spanish food and traditions with other friends because it is a topic I am fascinated about. My point is that "racism" is not so simple as having a cap on a particular race. We should ask what effects such a cap would have and whether that effect is a good thing. For example, excluding blacks from voting has no readily justifiable basis/effect.|~|23|~|Tuesday, February 17, 2015 1:38 AM|~|1859415376|~|NA|~|0

78588|~|#stopparton2015|~|I have to disagree with the foundation on which your argument stands. You are comparing Jewish admission 20 years ago with Asian admission today. Because the Jewish population made up 3% of the nation, sure the 27% was an overrepresentation. But America's current Asian one represents 5.3% of the population ("United States Department of Health & Human Services. 17 September 2012"), and 20~21% hardly seems like the U's being 'discriminatory' against these new 'victims'. |~|19|~|Monday, February 16, 2015 8:39 PM|~|1859131645|~|NA|~|1

78588|~|Try again|~|Don't rehash old arguments. If you do, at least extend them. Before you put pen to paper, ask yourself what questions/counter arguments haven't been raised before, and address these. We've all heard the "replace race-based admissions with socioeconomic preference" argument a million times. But let's say you get rid of race-based affirmative action completely, tell admissions officials to get rid of the race box, and instruct them to only consider an applicant's socioeconomic situation. How would you account for the differences in hardship between, for example, a poor white or Asian kid and a poor black kid? Are you prepared to say, for example, a US-born child of Chinese immigrants from Flushing, Queens faces the same problems as a black kid from Brownsville, Brooklyn? The black kid is over 20 times more likely to be killed by a police officer than the Chinese kid. He's way more likely to end up in prison than the Chinese kid if they both commit similar offenses. He's more likely to be the victim of policy brutality and gang-related violence. If, in the future, he submits a job application, he is less likely to be called back if he has a "black" name, whereas the Chinese kid probably won't face the same problem. By arguing for socioeconomic preference, you have already conceded that some discrimination is "just" if it will assist an under-served group. Will you argue that these racial disparities are not, in and of themselves, forms of hardship? Isn't this exactly what you're saying when you propose to "divorce applications from names", only consider socioeconomic background, and get rid of the race box?|~|11|~|Monday, February 16, 2015 11:12 PM|~|1859300027|~|NA|~|0

This is an issue that cannot be adequately analyzed in a short op ed. It is a big question. Should big questions be tackled, certainly. But, before you spread polemic next time, I would really hope you would do a little more research than just looking at CalTech's enrollment. There are a multitude of other factors that could cause their enrollments to look a lot different than ours. or Harvard's. or Yale's. This might be a good statistical project to work out if you have the time in the coming semester. If you feel passionately about it, perhaps you could undertake it as part of your independent work.

Something that is touched on in some of the previous comments but I would like to expand on: the university loves to show off its diversity, but it's really shallow. Take a look at the black and Hispanic friends you have. How many of them are from lower class families, and how many of them have engineers, lawyers and doctors for parents? PU appears to pick students who make for good photo-shoots, "brochure diversity" is what I like to call it, just for the appearance of a diversity that, upon closer inspection, is only skin-deep. Almost all of my minority (black, Hispanic, Asian, Jewish [do they even count as a minority anymore?]) friends when I was at PU were from wealthy suburbs of Chicago, NYC ('burbs, or Manhattan), LA, etc. On the other hand, the people I knew who tended to have the hardest time adjusting to the general culture at Princeton (which I see as a good measure of bringing diversity to the table) were those from rural areas - regardless of their skin color. They were from West Virginia, Kansas, Minnesota, Tennessee, etc. Most didn't have iPhones. Many had worked, and, sometimes, lived on farms growing up, getting up two hours before school started to collect eggs. They were often deeply religious, much more so than their upper-middle class classmates. They were blue-collar America. That's diversity in a place like Princeton. You want racial diversity? Fine, put some effort into getting black kids out of the hood rather than taking the polished ones from the suburbs. Take a chance on the kids of migrant workers who show above average intelligence in school. The admissions office needs to stop taking the easy way to diversity, which ultimately results in only shallow diversity.

78594|~|KR|~|Instead of becoming defensive and attacking Ms. Mubarak for the way she handled this article, perhaps we should take a step back and realize that she does not in any way diminish other tragedies or deaths, but rather seeks to call attention to a particular incident and the way it has been treated by the American media at large. Nowhere in this article does she imply that we should ignore lives taken by anyone—she just wants us to examine how sytemic prejudice affects the media and public's response. Whether or not the murderer killed the studetns because they were Muslim is only part of the issue; the fact that their deaths have received relatively little attention, presumably because of their religion, is a huge problem. While a speculative, hypothetical argument is not the most rigorous way to demonstrate Ms. Mubarak's point, it is nevertheless effective in raising the "what if" question and forcing us to consider how this would be handled had the situation been reversed.

I think "What?" asked you to tell him/her who because I (or he/she) haven't heard any cases of anybody being outright raped at eating clubs. If its kept secret to protect the victim, well then you can't expect people to inherently know its a problem unless they see examples of it.

78643|~|Robert Riversong|~|What we have also learned from the reporting on campus sexual assault is that there are more false allegations than the advocacy community is willing to admit. The Columbia "mattress" case is another prominent likely misrepresentation (see:  A Model of Campus Gender-Based Harassment ). Given that only 9% of those who did not report  alleged  sexual assaults in the 2014 DOJ national study gave as the reason that "the police would not or could not do anything to help", fear of the legal process was the least common reason. Mandatory reporting will go a long way to reducing frivolous or malicious claims of "rape", and will not prevent schools from doing what they are most capable of doing: providing support and counseling to  alleged  sexual assault victims. The current reinterpretation of Title IX (which does not say a word about sexual harassment, let alone sexual assault) forces colleges to create extra-legal tribunals and engage in investigation and adjudication of felony crimes - that the legal system is far better able to do - and to deprive the accused of due process protections.

78643|~|Anonymous Tipping|~|Excellent article, Marni. I was a victim of sexual assault in college (at a different Ivy League school), and while every victim is different, here's my personal take: I did not report to police. It's bad enough to be a victim, but having to live as a victim - talking through the issues with police, etc. - is an entirely different thing. I realize everyone deals with things in their own way, but for me, anonymous reporting through text is the only way I would have ever reported it. Mandatory reporting would have discouraged me further. But as I said, I'm only 1 victim, and I understand that this is an incredibly complicated issue. I agree with Marni - let's focus on curbing rape culture. TRAININGS on prevention should be mandatory for both female and male students, especially in fraternities and sororities.

78450|~|the three of us|~|This article presupposes that everyone at Princeton disagrees with Patton and continues the narrative that everything she says has no nuances. The idea that she claimed that all victims of sexual assault are complicit is false. Patton, in fact at the Princeton panel, stated "If you're the victim of sexual assault then clearly that's a crime that's punishable" ( http://www.thedatereport.com/d... . What Patton seems to be referring to are cases like at Occidental College ( http://www.businessinsider.com...  or at Columbia ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/... , which potentially trivialize real victims. In addition to those two nationally publicized cases, we have the insanity surrounding the "narrative" at UVA. The way the media encourages and reports upon these occurrences and the way the university handles them is not fair to both parties involved. Emma Sulkowicz has become a hero by publicly shaming someone found not guilty in three separate cases. How would it benefit Columbia to mishandle three separate cases when there is so much national attention on this issue?  Looking back at the interview I cited above, we see that perhaps Patton isn't so far off the mark when Fallon makes a comment about regrettable sex.  "Fallon: The idea that what rape really is under these circumstances is women who go out, they get drunk and say ‘Yeah, let’s have sex’ and then afterwards they say ‘Aw, I feel so bad now, I probably shouldn’t have done that’ and then report it as rape–that is not the phenomena that actually happens. Patton: Sometimes it’s the phenomena that happens. Fallon: It’s not though."|~|7|~|Monday, February 16, 2015 10:39 AM|~|1858172362|~|NA|~|0

I'd watched all the nominees (and popular "snubbed" films) (with the exception of Birdman) prior to the Oscar nominee announcement and felt no wrong doing had been done.  These guys watch movies for a living, and they could see right through Selma's lack of interpretative character.  Movies like that don't win best picture.  There wasn't enough directive charisma to warrant the film any more attention than as a run-of-the-mill biopic.

To say it's racism is just stupid. Just last year Oscar winners included 12 years a slave and Nyong'o; this year one "meh" movie is slighted and the entire academy is racist? And in a free country a race cannot have a monopoly on an entire sect of music. Yes, rap is an African American art. But the thing with America is that it's open.

78171|~|Too Controversial for Names|~|Azza, talk is cheap. The ideals of acceptance, integration, multiculturalism, assimilation, all look very different from Le Marais than they do from Highland Park. It's one thing to urge others to risk their lives to help erase stereotypes and liberalize France, and quite another to do it oneself. As long as Netanyahu isn't coercing the Jewish population but merely holding out his country's welcome, it is childish to "accuse" him of anything. The other thing that your column, intentionally or not, seems to have missed is the type of people who are committing these antisemitic crimes. As impolitic as it may be to say, all of the perpetrators in the three examples you gave were Muslims of North African descent all of whom identified, at least in part, with al-Qaeda: from Youssouf Fofana to Mohamed Merah. This, then, is not a case of the general population of France distrusting and occasionally assaulting Jews, but a case of a radical Islamist population (likely a small minority within France's 10% Muslim population) believing the murder of Jews to be a politically or religiously worthy exercise. With this in mind, urging French Jews to stay will do little if anything to solve their problems. For as long as dedicated, militant Islamist extremists abound in French cities, seeking out and brutally murdering Jews based on their ethnic and religious characteristics, I will not fault a single emigrée.|~|9|~|Thursday, February 12, 2015 11:03 AM|~|1849883943|~|NA|~|0

As PICS interns (and prospective interns with offers) are well aware, the PICS Program – as an independent alumni organization – is fully funded by non-University sources.  We are incredibly grateful for the continued and growing support of our Princeton alumni, program alumni, and other sponsors which makes possible the meaningful opportunities we provide to our interns.  And while program administrators and funders are continually seeking to expand the program and recognize the needs of our interns, our commitment is to investing our limited resources in increasing our internship offerings rather than increasing the stipend provided to our students.  We hope that prospective applicants to the PICS program will understand this commitment and will recognize the tremendous support of our sponsors.

77954|~|Carlos Sotelo |~|As someone on full FA who had to decide between which summer internship programs to apply to, you are correct that internship compensation was my first priority. However, I think your criticisms against PICS while elevating IIP do not paint the full picture, and can be quite misleading as to which program provides the best model for financial support, and fails to address another key thing, support in general. While it is true that IIP can cover any expenses related to the internship, that is where it stops, it does not go further than that. On the other hand, PICS compensation provides a $4,500 stipend in which the student can spend any way they desire to, obviously aimed to cover or help cover any expenses relating to the internship. Besides its civic-minded internships that attracted me, I chose PICS because of the flexibility it allowed with its financial generosity. I needed an internship in which I could generate income, not just meet my living needs, and IIP does not allow for that. I needed money to help support both myself during the summer, but would then go towards paying for my expected summer contribution towards my very own FA for the upcoming year, and IIP does not allow for that. I needed money to help support my family back home as needed, and IIP does not allow for that. If you are resourceful and can manage your money well, then even living in a expensive city, like I did for PICS in Boston this past summer, then you can still generate an income from a PICS stipend. It takes some budgeting, but it is entirely possible to do so. The PICS staff was so understanding of my situation and when a financial emergency occurred in which I was left with only $18 in my bank account after using my previous finances to pay for my first month's rent and 2 weeks of food and transportation costs, they were able to advance my paycheck days earlier than it should have been processed, and I can not thank them enough for that. After that first paycheck, I did not encounter any other financial problems, and still managed to enjoy Boston immensely, even with the financial limits I placed on myself. Not only that, but PICS Staff continued to check up on me, as they do with every intern, to ask about my internship and how things were going in a new city. Moreover, IIP doesn't have the alumni mentorship component that PICS has. Having a Princeton alumni mentor was invaluable, as they helped connect me to a great network, were vested in my interests and development, and made living in a new city much easier through advice of all types and taking me out in the city. I strongly encourage any undergrad to consider a PICS internship simply because of having this mentor and support network that cares about you having a meaningful internship and eases the experience of living on your own, for anyone. Because of that, I would say PICS provides the best internship experience especially for students on Financial Aid that would benefit from the opportunity to budget accordingly to their own needs so that they could potentially save some money on their own, and even more so for the high and unmatched level of support during the course of the internship that has continued afterwards. I don't mean to make it just sound like a promo for PICS, but I believe anyone reading this piece should know PICS is so much more than stipend.|~|0|~|Friday, February 13, 2015 1:32 PM|~|1852109764|~|NA|~|1

I go with Rehnquist's opinion in the Elk Grove case which says the term "under God" does not endorse or establish religion but merely acknowledges the nation's religious heritage, in particular the role of religion in our Founding. Thus, the Pledge is a secular remembrance of shared history rather than an act of indoctrination in religion or expression of religious devotion.

It serves to reinforce gender norms, which is not a step forward for women, and it would pose an inconvenience to men who, in some areas, will now have half as many bathrooms and showers as women do. If we are to make a gendered bathroom coed, so too must the gendered bathroom down the hall become coed -- which, to iterate, has not created massive insecurity among students at the colleges where this has been done.|~|8|~|Sunday, February 8, 2015 11:07 PM|~|1843020758|~|NA|~|1

I was also a MOL major. Yes, you can study abroad, but you have to jump through a lot of hoops. One of your summers (before your senior year) is already occupied by labwork, unless you're one of the few students who writes a non-lab thesis. I would have loved to go to Kinshasa or Dhaka to do bench research with enteric pathogens, places where people have to deal with that disease burden daily. Too bad that is near next to impossible in the MOL department. The problem with this op-ed is how shallow it is while claiming to speak to all students. Since the title is "Why we should ALL (emphasis mine obviously) study abroad," maybe the author should have thought about some barriers to study abroad for departments other than her own and advocated for them to make it easier.

It was practical advice my own mother would give me (and often does) if I was a woman to whom marriage is important. And Patton's rape comments are not about violent man-jumps-out-of-bush rape.  I think EVERYONE on campus and AMERICA agrees already that that kind of black and white violent rape is wrong and horrible.  What Patton is talking about is grey area rape where alcohol is involved and so both men and women contribute to a confusing situation.  Maybe instead of placing all the responsibility for these situations on men's shoulders, we SHOULD be looking at women's roles, how they might also be contributing to a confusing situation, and stop calling it victim blaming.  As a woman who is sick of feminists trying to convince me that I have zero agency, I find it empowering that a woman is telling me I can take responsibility for my own body and experiences without having to place all the responsibility for romantic encounters on a man's shoulders.|~|21|~|Monday, February 9, 2015 9:39 AM|~|1843607133|~|1842911527|~|1

Add alcohol and drugs into the mix and you do, in fact, get a ton of grey area.  It's confusing for everyone.  We keep trying to put black and white band-aids on grey problems which is why a solution keeps alluding us.  Only looking at men's behavior is being willfully ignorant and purposefully ignoring possible solutions to the problem, all so women can feel less victimized (I'm not sure by who, the only people creating victims are feminists by the very way they talk about this problem).

77677|~|ShadrachSmith|~|Said Patton on CNN We're talking about nothing but rape on campus, it seems like, for the last several weeks or months, but I think what makes this conversation so particularly prickly is the definition of rape. It no longer is when a woman is violated at the point of a gun or knife. We're now talking about, or identifying as rape, what really is a clumsy hookup melodrama, or a fumbled attempt at a kiss or a caress … To me, that’s not a crime. That’s not rape. That’s a learning experience.  Poor word choice on the last two words, better would have been, ...that's a total bummer, but it isn't rape. And I will defend that position. We have all watched Girls Gone Wild videos. We all know what to expect when inexperienced women, alcohol, and the frenzy of missing out on something exciting works its timeless way on young people. With the clear understanding that this kind of thing can happen,  Chose where you go to party, and where you get drunk.

This should not be a male v. female issue. The problem is cultural-- men who think having sex with a passed out drunk girl is acceptable are a sign of something broken in our society.

That doesn't sound like much oversight to me. The Prince Staff accepts that the Editorial Board is an institution independent of the Prince and encourages it to establish or strengthen internal accountability mechanisms. Without any system of accountability, the Editorial Board and its officers cannot take active measures to correct practices that make reading editorials unnecessarily unpleasant for Prince staffers whose opinions are being notionally represented. A more transparent process would give the Editorial Board the information it needs to prevent future transgressions. Often times, the line between what opinions are allowed and what opinions are discouraged is blurred and Board members accidentally cross the line. With clearer instructions before an Editorial begins and a better reporting mechanism, officers can become more aware of what lines may have been crossed so they can clarify guidelines with offending Board members.

It's supposed to educate and make readers think about why, although the page can and should definitely do a better job of explaining specific instances. One other thing I think you might be getting wrong -- microaggressions operate in the same way as sexism, racism, etc. albeit on a smaller scale. There is no such thing as reverse-sexism or reverse-racism on a blatant level, and there isn't on a microaggressive level either. That's not what that term is for -- it's for actually oppressive undercurrents and there needs to be a bigger system there.|~|1|~|Wednesday, February 4, 2015 10:40 PM|~|1835821872|~|NA|~|0

It's fine in an academic setting, but I really do think that it's been ineffective as a tool for public awareness. Even many people that are supportive of efforts to fight everyday oppression dismiss the term. This pretty much boils down to a slight difference in rhetoric, though it's a somewhat important one, because to me if reflects a certain emphasis on the subjective and individual. Maybe that's not such a bad thing. But at least in the public consciousness, the link between microaggression and societal injustice is far too indirect.|~|2|~|Wednesday, February 4, 2015 11:16 PM|~|1835855698|~|1835821872|~|1

77393|~|Ernest Phlegmingway|~|I think the fundamental question is whether or not the Prince wants to be treated like a professional newspaper. The Prince and its defenders often justify what they do - things like publishing the names of people arrested for nonviolent offenses - by saying they're doing what professional organizations like the New York Times do. That's sort of an ok argument. But now this piece appears in the paper, telling people that the paper's motives should not be questioned because the people who work on it work hard. First of all, that logic doesn't make sense - you can work hard on a misguided project. Second, would the New York Times publish an opinion piece that pleads for its dedicated staff to be treated kindly while completely failing to address the reasons people take issue with it in the first place? My guess is no, the New York Times would respond to outside scrutiny by examining its practices, changing them if it needs to, and continuing to go about its business like a real newspaper.|~|36|~|Thursday, February 5, 2015 12:14 AM|~|1835917410|~|NA|~|0
77393|~|Christian Wawrzonek '16|~|You bring up a fantastic point and one that was the center the 3 hour discussion that I alluded to. Steve Swanson has the right of it; it's just impossible to capture all the nuances I covered in 800 words. However, I'll do my best to address your point. First of all, I want to clarify that I'm not using the staff's work ethic as justification of the quality of the paper. Rather, I was doing it simply to create sympathy for the staff and highlighting the fact that their efforts are a near thankless job right now, given the negativity from the student body. With that said, professionalism is a very difficult issue. Before the discussion, I was of the mind that the Prince should strive to be a professional paper to the best of its ability. I argued that any source of public information that intentionally alters what it publishes in order to fit the motives of any third part immediately decreases its value as an objective source of information. For this reason, I justified the publishing of names etc, because if the newspaper altered what it published in order to benefit its student, then it could no longer claim to be an unbiased, objective source of information. But, of course I've changed this opinion to some extent. To be honest (and I have to emphasize that this is entirely my own opinion), the Prince is not the New York Times, nor can it ever be. As a school newspaper that serves a community of only 5-10 thousand readers, it has to operate differently than a publication that serves millions and millions of readers. Most of all I want to address your analogy to the NY Times once more. You say that the Times would never "plead for its dedicated staff to be treated kindly." Well of course not, because again they serve millions of anonymous readers. But this community of 5,000 students is not anonymous, and any insults you throw end up in the face of your friends and my friends, not to mention fellow Princeton students. This is part of the thinking that has lead me to question name publication. In addition, as a member of this very tight knit community, you have a privileged position to substantially change this paper. This doesn't mean you have to join the paper and write articles. Simply engage the paper, as you've just done. Write to Anna with your concerns, and email me. If you package your criticisms as insults and vitriol, the paper cannot and will never improve, and that I firmly believe this. If you want to see a change in our paper, be respectful.

The propriety of a student run community newspaper acting like an impersonal, professional paper is a much more involved topic than could be fit in these 800 words.

The immature, defensive individual says, "You're wrong!" and lambasts critics for their opinions. The Prince, unfortunately, too often falls into this latter category. Don't attack the public for their (often valid) criticisms. Address these issues (if you wish) not through opinions pieces but by writing thorough, well-researched articles with solid reporting.

Before I can address specific issues, the readers have to acknowledge that the Prince's intentions are correct, and that their means are debatable.

77393|~|NeuroMonkey|~|As a pretty consistent reader (breakfast news), I feel like a lot of us tend to gloss over the fact that we do get a lot of breaking news from the Prince by saying that they wrote questionable articles. I agree that some articles were a bit unnecessary, but there are a lot of points where the Prince covered hard fact or breaking events. As a now Neuro major, I know that neither I nor my friends had any clue that the school was planning on creating a new Neuroscience major. How they managed to discover that is incredible to me. I think the coverage of that and the protest/walkout was very much on point. You also have to consider the fact that Princeton is a small town with not much going on, compared to NYTimes, which can cover anything it wants. As a daily, the Prince has to provide readers with news even if we personally have something against it. If you read the Harvard Crimson (which no one does, but as a point of comparison), they literally write about only two things: professors and classes. They even cover some more national news AFTER the Prince has already covered it. While course/professor profiles might be interesting, it gets a little old and doesn't cover nearly half of what ACTUALLY goes on at the campus. To me, good reporting means scouting out every facet of student life and not just writing on the courses and professors, which caters to a certain crowd. With that, you have to touch on some controversy at one point or another. What makes me ill is when reporters get cursed out by the people they're speaking with. I understand if you have something against an article, but invective is not necessary, and my friend's roommate was in tears at one point. So yes, some of the more personal attacks on writers and whatnot are a bit unwarranted considering that they're being journalists and students at the same time. I think the Prince could learn from these points and improve.|~|8|~|Friday, February 6, 2015 11:54 AM|~|1838746076|~|NA|~|0

77393|~|Christian Wawrzonek '16|~|Thanks for the response. For the record, I was not specifically referring to the TI incident. In my original draft, I had written "recent events at TI." I later changed it to sexual assault allegations to refer to the broader issue of sexual assault on campus, and also because I refer to the TI incident specifically later in the column. If you notice in my 5th paragraph, I refer to this specific issue as "Tiger Inn gossiping," because I recognize the ambiguity of the situation as well as the views from the student body. Actually, I have a very similar stance to you here. I don't think anything wrong happened at TI, other than perhaps some indecent exposure. Please do not attempt to read between the lines to find a hidden agenda. As I stated before, my opinions are entirely my own and uninfluenced by the staff itself, aside from suggestions I receive from my editor (which are entirely optional changes of course). It saddens me deeply to see that you would immediately dismiss my column as a ploy to hide malicious intentions. I think this speaks volumes to the level of mistrust of the paper on this campus. But that is the very reason I wrote this column. Please, give me and the staff a chance to have an open discussion about this issue, because I care about the way this paper is seen by the student body, and I want to improve it.|~|16|~|Wednesday, February 4, 2015 10:30 PM|~|1835810965|~|1835764420|~|1

77393|~|bokmeow|~|One of the fundamental problems with The Daily Princetonian is the wild inconsistency in reporting, and sometimes not reporting at all. I can remember one example of this a couple years back, when former Israel Prime Minister Ehud Olmert came to speak at the Princeton University Woodrow Wilson School, and if you read the piece, it does not even seem evident that the reporter had attended the talk -- the reporter may have even just transcribed the event from an advanced version of the speech provided to the newspaper. Why do I know? Because #1, the paper describes Olmert delivering the talk to a full McCosh 50, in stark contrast to large sections of empty seats according to students who had attended; #2, a vocal challenge to Olmert for his role in the shocking assault on Palestinians during Operation Cast Lead, and his even more shocking dismissal of the question, was not mentioned. It would be surprising that something this noteworthy was not reported as news.  Read for yourself:  http://dailyprincetonian.com/n... If Daily Princetonian doesn't find some independence to engage in actual news reporting, it cannot fault the community for mocking it openly as barely acceptable to be used for fish wrap. There's a reason why other alternative publications on The Princeton University campus have been the go-to for exclusives.|~|2|~|Friday, February 6, 2015 1:20 PM|~|1838934350|~|NA|~|1

Of course the PKK has been shamefully violent at times, and there's obviously quite a history of atrocities on both sides. I could describe PKK's violence, and then I could go back even further and describe how the Kurdish lands were divided up into Iraq, Turkey, and Syria by European powers in order to fulfill a naive ideal of balance of power (and all the problems that's caused since -- because you can't just draw countries on a map like that), or I could just start with the Arab conquests of Mesopotamia and go from there. If we want to stick with the second half of the 20th century, I could describe the Turkish policies that have reinforced violence between the government and the PKK, and all the corruption and connections to drug trade and hired killers on both sides of the fight (and the Western intelligence agencies supporting that). I could talk about Hussein's persecution of the Kurds, and the lack of political representation they've had in any of the countries they live in. It's a long and ugly history in a region full of long and ugly histories. I'd encourage anyone who wants to learn more to do so.

Since the late 90s they've adopted a new ideology inspired by the philosophy of the anarchist Murray Bookchin called radical democratic confederalism -- making them, basically, strident anti-nationalist anarchists who believe in replacing the nation-state and capitalism with pluralistic and diverse municipal communities founded on principles of mutual aid and direct democracy, with institutions designed to respect the customs of particular communities while allowing total freedom of movement and goods between them.  The reports from Kobani and the other two free cantons under PKK control in Syrian Kurdistan are astonishing.  As a non-primitivist and forward-looking anarcho-socialist society, they not only present us with the best way of combating fundamentalist Islam in the Middle East but with a model with which to replace our own thoroughly corrupt, anti-democratic, oligarchical, and imperialistic political and economic structures right here in the good old US of A.|~|0|~|Wednesday, February 4, 2015 6:40 PM|~|1835534441|~|1833860370|~|1

Since upperclassmen do not have RCAs, I wonder whose job it was to inform them? The suddenness of the change was really unnecessary.

I'm a DA, and we were sent emails early on the Monday of intersession informing us of the impending change to the bathroom codes and requesting us to send those codes to our female residents. If any girls didn't get the code for their dorm, it would be due to the negligence of their DA or RCA, in most cases. However, there's a very real possibility that some DAs/RCAs simply did not have a chance to check their email during the week bc of a myriad of potential reasons. I think this is something the University could have avoided, maybe by waiting until after intersession so that more people would be around to ask about it? I'm glad they did change the codes; I think it was a good idea to do that. I think they could have implemented that change in a better way, though. |~|1|~|Thursday, February 5, 2015 12:30 AM|~|1835933253|~|1833924382|~|0

But the University generally asks less of these people, they're in charge of more students, and students are less likely to be in communication with them, so it's not at all surprising that girls in upperclass housing were left in the lurch. |~|1|~|Wednesday, February 4, 2015 9:47 AM|~|1834543414|~|1833924382|~|0

77060|~|just a number '16|~|This is so true. A person who has never lived in poverty will never understand what it feels like to know that the future of your entire family depends on your grades. You feel that you need to succeed, because even though Princeton provides very generous financial aid you still feel poor. One example of this is how many people take classes over the summer, but you can't afford to, because even though you can loan money from Princeton to cover the costs of tuition at the university where you want to take the summer classes, you still need to pay for rent and food. And you can't work during the school year because you can barely keep up with your classes because everyone else is so much better prepared than you. Or you have to take MAT 103 because your school math classes were a joke. And all of the other engineers are starting math with multivariable calculus which many of them have already covered in high school so much of the material isn't new to them at all. And you have to take 5 hard classes in one semester, classes that other people usually take one or two at a time cushioning them with easy courses. And you HAVE to major in engineering, because if you major in something like classics or psychology you will feel terribly guilty that you won't earn as much money and won't be able to repay your parents for the sacrifices they made. Yes, the application fee of $80 is a huge sacrifice. An american teenager might earn $80 by working at McDonalds for a couple of hours on weekends. Not so for international students from poor countries. An adult would have to work for days to earn half of that sum.  And then the nagging feeling that you were only accepted because you're poor and would "bring diversity". So I'm not really that smart? I'm not really cut out for this place, I just got here by accident because you wanted to say on your admissions website that you accepted people from 71 different countries, not 70? Because I'm the only person from my continent who applied to Princeton and had non-terrible SAT scores? A part of me understands that if I could accomplish this much given my background I must be worthy of a slot in the Class of 2016, but I still feel miserable and unhappy. I don't know how the author of this article was confident enough to sign his name, I can't do that.|~|45|~|Monday, February 2, 2015 10:14 PM|~|1831746437|~|NA|~|0
77060|~|mikay|~|Matt, I'm glad that you're willing to see the immense opportunity (and burden) given to you by your acceptance into this university.  The academic and social challenges you face here are undoubtedly greater than those your peers face.  I have infinitely more respect for you because you're willing to own up to these comparative disadvantages, and see them as something only you can bear, and similarly, only you can fight through.  A number of previous writers from similar backgrounds (low-income, no college educated parent, etc.) have chosen to frame their disadvantage as something that needs to be actively eased by the university, whether thats through special departments, funds, or otherwise.  While I believe some degree of assistance is expected to individuals from truly adverse backgrounds, to frame one's existence solely as one to be pitied is frankly, incredibly demeaning.  Your attitude of perseverance will result in immense personal growth, I'm positive of that.  Congrats on a great first article and i wish you the best of luck with your college career.|~|9|~|Monday, February 2, 2015 10:07 PM|~|1831737929|~|NA|~|0
77060|~|sigh|~|Dear shitty dude who still doesn't get it: writing an article criticizing the university for not supporting its poorer students as much as it could is not the same as framing your existence solely as one to be pitied. There isn't a single low-income Princetonian who didn't get here by pulling themselves up by their bootstraps in the face of immense challenges that most Princetonians can hardly fathom. Princetonians are under pressure all of the time to act as if everything is fine, as if they don't need help, as if they can handle all of life's challenges on their own and then take on some of those for others. Making comments like these doesn't just misrepresent the personalities of the sorts of people who make it into Princeton against all odds, it makes worse a toxic culture that too often ruins and even ends lives. I don't know how old you are, but I really hope that someday you'll grow up.|~|13|~|Tuesday, February 3, 2015 2:11 AM|~|1831947541|~|1831737929|~|0
77060|~|sigh...|~|Thank you for being brave enough to write this...it's true that no one will have any idea how it is to have fought their way through poverty at one point in their lives. It was just yesterday when my parents were forced to shop at the dollar store and our clothing was bought from the most bottom-of-the-bin remnant sales. We could just barely pay for shelter and what little we had left went towards buying stale food. In high school I fought tooth and nail to succeed, and I felt ashamed because I couldn't afford all of the trendiest threads and never took summer school/SAT prep classes/study abroad immersion like the other kids did. Out of this extreme fight for survival, I somehow emerged stronger and more knowledgeable about the world. My sheltered friends threw money around like it was nothing, while I desperately tried to save for college, textbooks, and travel fees. Although I try to glaze over my past that I spent in poverty, I feel that guilt over trying to hide a part of me and cover it up with my academics. It's something that I never let people know, and if I told them, they'd be really surprised because I never gave any intimation of what I've been through. Although the worst has passed, it's still so easy to remember living in those conditions and I still experience despair when I can hardly afford textbooks and all of the extra expenses that come up over the year. Or when my parents are fretting over how they can bring me home over break. Or even when I realize that I can't major in the humanities because my family can't afford it--if I can't get a job, then I'll only be a burden. It's feels like a vise closing me in from all sides, forcing me to claw my way up and do well through my grades. Yet at the same time my experiences have prepared me for the real world far more than anything else, and it only helps me to grow. I feel grateful and ungrateful at the same time here, and its a feeling that can't be described easily, but you pretty much nailed it.|~|8|~|Monday, February 2, 2015 11:19 PM|~|1831812662|~|NA|~|0

76945|~|Reading Comprehension|~|Hi Anna, I have a few comments, and I hope you take a chance to read this and incorporate some feedback: - I understand students here demand substantive news stories, but it can often feel like there isn't anything going on. I think we just have to dig deeper to find stories. Talk to professors and see what they're up to. Professors are engaged in an incredible variety of things around campus and outside of campus (a lot of professors do consulting for high profile leaders, a lot of the institutes here churn out fantastic research, etc). Highlight and profile these. Students here love to know what Princeton as a whole is up to! - Cut down the number of opinion articles. I don't think there are enough topics to be able to write SO many opinion pieces that are published every day. By cutting down on quantity, you have a chance to improve on quality (people can muse less and opinion more).  - The brief period when the Prince focused on mental health was excellent! Those are examples of what opinion pieces and editorials should be. They were tightly focused, compelling, and had a call to action. Not all topics are as deeply entrenched or as immediately obvious, but if you can't do this, it doesn't deserve an opinion piece. - Pull in more campus writers by having people who write comments, etc. write opinion pieces.

76945|~|Christian Wawrzonek '16|~|Just a quick response to your point about opinion columns. I would say, instead of cutting down on the number of columns, give more liberty to the columnists. All columnists are encouraged to write specifically about their opinions on princeton related issues. This obviously goes dry pretty fast. It's only been in this past year that I've started to branch out and explore outside issues that I've found more ideas and novel columns (with the exception of my most recent of course). But I appreciate your suggestion on that, and I recognize that columns tend to be very redundant. Hopefully Anna will look at this in more detail. Thanks :)|~|0|~|Wednesday, February 4, 2015 9:49 PM|~|1835769389|~|1831147475|~|1

76949|~|'16|~|What you're saying is true. However, for the Princeton students who are so lucky (which is many, even if not you and me) it is a career path that isn't often considered. Princeton students go on autopilot into consulting, finance, or grad school because that's all they see their friends do. Chin '06 is writing to show those of us about to graduate that there are other options. If you choose not to take that option, for whatever reason, good for you. I will also not be following in the footsteps of Chin '06. Chin '06 isn't bragging about the privilege he has, and he's not saying every single Princeton grad should go into education. He is trying to use some of the privilege he was born with to make the world a better place, especially for those born with less privilege. Are you? Just pointing at this and saying "you have privilege" is not a counterargument. There are many good arguments about Teach for America's efficacy and impact on education in the US. But yours is not one of them.|~|12|~|Sunday, February 1, 2015 11:32 PM|~|1830040788|~|1829968032|~|0

76714|~|'16|~|But Marcelo, the thing is that it's not just because of the Prince's negative portrayal of "certain aspects of student life" that so many students are so bothered by the paper. Rather, I think it's because of an overall disregard for the effects that certain reportage might have, and a reliance on negative narratives that borders on the gratuitous. Posting Sean Warren's Facebook profile, to use one recent example, is far outside the pale of conventional journalistic ethics, and opens a man guilty of nothing up to serious harassment. Perhaps the best example I have, however, comes from this year's elections. An alumnus, one who had run afoul of underage drinking laws while an eating club officer in the late '80s, was elected as the Delaware state Treasurer. Did the Prince not mention it, since it wasn't really germane to the story? Did it simply put it as a minor note in the article? No, it printed the alarmist-sounding headline "Alumnus convicted on alcohol charges while at U. elected Delaware State Treasurer"—a gratuitous way of making sure a minor misstep which has no bearing on his current life will forever be one of his first google results. This is disrespectful, unnecessary, and has nothing to do with journalistic ethics. To echo your closing line, Marcelo, I hope you are proud to be responsible for flagrant, mean-spirited character assassinations like this one.|~|200|~|Monday, January 12, 2015 3:38 AM|~|1788090878|~|NA|~|0
76714|~|Okay, but...|~|Most of the backlash against the Prince was due to two things: its coverage of TI and its decision to name students who were arrested for allegedly breaking drug laws, both of which, in my opinion, are completely justified. God forbid a company who wants to hire a student in the future not perform a rigorous background check. If the drug offense is as "harmless" as 90% of the commenters here insist it is, then companies should look past it either way, right? In these cases, it's not a newspaper's responsibility to think about the consequences that the report will have on the alleged criminals - it is simply the newspaper's job the report the facts as clearly and as accurately as they come. I, for one, admire the fact that Marcelo stuck up for his reporters, because the reporters have taken a lot of unfair abuse from people who gladly hide behind the curtain of anonymity. Calling a reporter "70 pounds of pure evil", or insinuating that he or she got in on Affirmative Action, for example, is not constructive at all. I'm glad Marcelo is taking the chance to clear up the misconception that the reporters make editorial decisions.|~|62|~|Monday, January 12, 2015 11:16 AM|~|1788584628|~|1788090878|~|0
76714|~|Editor|~|The backlash against the Prince has to do with the "questionable behavior and wrongdoing" of the Prince's reporting and the perception that there is indeed an agenda. And it is a mean spirited one.  You cannot hide behind lofty statements of purity of intent when in fact you are playing 'gotcha' rag journalism and are using a powerful student  platform to at times create news.   The Prince has made some ethically questionable decisions, ones upon which  a professional journalist with a real editorial board would be challenged.   "All the news that is fit to print". Is that the standard that Marcelo and the  new editor Anna are using? How does that apply to the incendiary  Facebook posting of an innocent man who works at a club. Or the headline article about an eating club officer violation from the 1980's dragged up on the new  Delaware Treasurer.  Was that "fit to print". When the Prince reporter called to check with the politicians opponent as to how they viewed the  eating club alcohol issue dragged up by the Prince , they dismissed it as irrelevant.  I would say petty and childish and clearly driven by emotional intent. It is angry and spiteful.  It is clear that the Prince's staff are students first and then journalists - not the other way around.|~|51|~|Monday, January 12, 2015 2:28 PM|~|1788944861|~|1788584628|~|0
76714|~|Christian Wawrzonek '16|~|I just don't get it. I've heard this a million times, but still I don't get it. Do you really think that the entire Prince staff has an agenda? Do you really think that of the 100+ students associated with this paper, every one of them applied to work on the Prince with the intention of shamelessly attacking people or drumming up fake news? Do you actually know anybody on the Prince staff personally? If you have a problem with the quality of the paper, then that is an issue that I think can be reconciled with proper communication and constructive criticism. But if you seriously mean to tell me that all Prince writers are selfish, mean-spirited, "angry and spiteful" jerks, then I just don't know what to tell you other than you are seriously blinded by a deep seated, implicit hatred of this newspaper. I can't imagine the staff staying up till 3am every night, driven by some spiteful rage to take down the student body. No. They do it because they love journalism, and I promise you that they all aspire to be the best journalists that they can be. And again, if you think they haven't lived up to that aspiration, feel free to say so. But don't question their intentions and don't question their character. And certainly don't fool yourself into believing in some vast conspiracy behind the evil Prince trying to destroy the integrity of the Princeton community. As an aside, I use the term "they" to refer to the news staff, as I think that this is where most of the major criticism has been directed lately. As an opinion columnist, I can say with utmost certainty that my articles are my own words, and nobody else's.|~|5|~|Saturday, January 17, 2015 1:38 PM|~|1798604437|~|1788944861|~|1
76714|~|Well...|~|The reason that was placed in the article was because that was what was particularly notable about his time at Princeton. If Ted Cruz had been arrested or something during his time here, the Prince would have probably ran the same thing. The Facebook issue is a bit more debatable, and obviously a case-by-case thing. But I call to mind the original TI story back in March or April (about the 21 club), where the reporter wisely and creatively used Hap Cooper's LinkedIn page to show that Cooper himself was 21 Club president. There is no agenda, you just try so hard to make it seem like there is one. |~|3|~|Wednesday, January 14, 2015 1:49 AM|~|1791693045|~|1788944861|~|0

76714|~|Guest|~|"DUDE" did YOU actually read my comment? Maybe ya did, but you must not have processed a damn thing. I gladly accept constructive criticism, as does the staff of the news section. But this was not constructive criticism, which is why I was mad. "Is this part of the joke issue?" Yeah hilarious. That will really help improve the quality of the Prince. Even your comment is a perfect example of this. What did you say in your comment other than "the Prince is a shit paper and everyone on it writes like shit...." Ok? I'll make sure to write down that wonderfully incisive argument and send it to Obama for his next speech. But that isn't even the worst of it. The most disgusting of all the criticisms thrown at the Prince is the all-too-common conspiracy theory that the writers somehow mean to dismantle the integrity of this school piece by piece, destroying the lives of every student and faculty member that get in the way, all for the sake of making exciting and catchy news stories. DUDE. They are students. They are my friends, and likely some of YOUR friends too if you happen to research who's on the staff at all. Most importantly, they are people who deserve respect. They are trying to do a decent job. If you think they are doing something wrong, be cordial and use CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM. THAT will get their attention, and that will lead to change. Insulting the writers and calling the Prince an "embarrassment" to the school name will NEVER change the Prince. Instead, it just makes people like me extremely cynical and dismissive of all the jerks who think that sitting behind their laptops, commenting how shitty every single character that comes out of the Prince is, or the audacity of any writer to put their name on such trash... well you can imagine how much I respect people like that.|~|0|~|Monday, January 26, 2015 11:12 PM|~|1819020464|~|1818993772|~|0

So someone wrote an article about something you or your friends did? Welcome to the 21st Century. I'm sorry earlier generations had it easier. How are you going to survive the real world? The students here who are writing foreign policy proposals for Woody Woo are often the same ones who are hosing people from eating clubs, excluding people from parties, making fun of non-'cool' people behind their backs, and then the university gives them some prize at graduation for their thesis and impact on the student body. Please, give me a break. I'm tired of immature middle schoolers at this school who won't take responsibility. Maybe some of the Prince articles brought up some issues that didn't paint certain student groups in the best light. So what?|~|22|~|Thursday, January 15, 2015 11:28 AM|~|1794114501|~|NA|~|0

Complaining about the school newspaper's inaccurate (and, on occasion, unnecessary and harmful) reporting and its effects does not make the students here 'babies'. And publishing something just because you can is no defense - people's right to information does not need to be extended to such superfluous information like a TI bouncer being investigated and quickly cleared of wrongdoing. No one benefited from that story, so why drag Sean's name through the mud and post his Facebook profile? This extends to the real world too. The values in this country have changed a lot over the last several decades, and while that has often been for the better there are many situations like this where I wish we were still beholden to the protestant values of yesteryeay|~|9|~|Thursday, January 15, 2015 5:37 PM|~|1794819612|~|1794114501|~|0

Take this as an example, the religious leaders were upset with Jesus for healing and doing other random things (Matthew 12:1-8) on the Sabbath, which they thought was against OT law. And then consider how the apostle Paul gave an entire speech saying it wasn't necessary for Christians to be circumcised. And then when God tells Peter in a dream that it's okay to eat pork now. And then there's even more verses in colossians 2 about this. And more, but there's too many to quote them all here.

While a few on the far left might make ignorant comments about Christianity, they come nowhere close to the level of popular support that anti-islamic sentiment has in PEGIDA, the French National Front, or UKIP. Radical Islamist groups grow by convincing Muslims that the West hates them, that they can never live a peaceful life in a Western-dominated world, and the fact that all of Islam catches flack when a few crazies do something like this only makes seem all the more right.|~|12|~|Monday, January 12, 2015 12:27 AM|~|1787973909|~|1787898823|~|0

You're right that people don't associate violence with Christianity in the same way that they associate it with Islam.  But if you look at the number of incidents of violent extremism from both religions, Christianity pales in comparison.  In order to form a major association between Islam and violence like the one so deeply ingrained in western belief, a significantly large proportion of an individual's observations of thing A must also coincide with thing B. As I stated in my other comment, most westerners don't really come in contact with peaceful Muslims, simply because the religion isn't as prevalent in western countries. They do however, hear a lot about the violent killings on the news.|~|3|~|Monday, January 12, 2015 1:55 AM|~|1788032633|~|1787973909|~|1
76673|~|Christian (but not Wawrzonek) |~|There's certainly an association. Underdevelopment, civil unrest, latent problems leftover from colonialism - all are associated with violence. And maybe poverty isn't strongly associated with jihad because a certain type of international terrorist needs to be educated enough to see Islam's and Muslims' degraded position and desire to do something about it. Regardless, Erika's point stands:we cannot allow the simplistic "Islam leads to terrorism" narrative to dominate, because it is these simplistic narratives - on both sides - which ultimately lead to violence. Rhetoric matters, and praising offensive satirists as infallible only strengthens that narrative. |~|3|~|Monday, January 12, 2015 8:43 AM|~|1788365512|~|1788032633|~|0

76673|~|Christian Wawrzonek '16|~|You're theme of "avoid oversimplification" is right, but probably also a bit trivial. Obviously we should know as much as possible about any issue, and no issue is really ever black and white. However, humans operate on heuristics. Nobody has the time, energy, willpower, or mental capacity to understand the ambiguities of every topic and every religion. Most individuals in the Western World have little to no exposure to Islam or its followers, except of course the news stories they hear with alarming frequency about the murder of non believers by extremists. Naturally, an association is going to form without deeper research into the proportion of extreme jihadists to the normal Muslim population. To your point about the equivalency of Muslim extremists vs Christian extremists. Note that of the entire world population, 1.6 billion identify as Muslim, or about 23 percent. 2.2 billion identify as Christian, or about 32 percent. Given these similar proportions, you would expect, based on your equivalence between religious extremists groups, a slightly higher percentage of terrorist attacks to come from Christians. In 2012, 17,891 deaths globally were attributed to terrorist attacks. For reference, I read: http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/he... and http://www.statista.com/statis... Admittedly, its difficult to tell exactly what religion, if any at all, motivated these attacks, but I'll break it down as best I can. An obvious culprit is only listed in about 1/3 of all cases, "but in those cases the most prolific named attackers were the Taliban, followed by al Qaeda in Iraq or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant." Quote taken directly from first article. Another key observation is that a third of all deaths (6,378) occurred in Iraq, the major battle ground of al Qqeda, followed closely by Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Important to note is that the 99.7 percent of Afghan citizens identify as Muslim, while 96 in Pakistan and 97 in Iraq. Clearly, a significant majority of religious terrorism is based rooted in Islamic violence. And of course, these figures don't account for the systemic oppression, persecution, and mutilation of women and non-muslims  under sharia law. 99 percent of Afghan citizens, 91 percent of Iraqi citizens, and 84 percent of Pakistani citizens support making sharia law the official law of their respective countries. You could argue that this is not inherently violent, and is not indicative of a violent religion. Arguably, Christians requiring the inclusion of God in many lawful documents could be seen as equivalent.  However, the important note here is that sharia law requires strict adherence to Islamic teaching including dress, diet, prayer, hygiene, and more personal liberties, with failure to do so resulting in physical punishment, even death. This is very different than insisting the word "God" be stated in the pledge of allegiance.  Given this, I think you would be hard pressed to argue that extremist Christianity is anywhere near as pressing of an issue as extremist Islam. Let me take a moment to say I am not saying Islam is inherently violent. I'm simply saying that drawing such an association is much more valid than drawing a similar association with Christianity, and attempting to equate the two is foolish given the current situation of the religious world. Here is where things get interesting. My initial thought was that the reason for a higher proportion of violent, radical Islam compared to Christianity is that cultures with a primarily Christian population are probably more developed, more economically successful countries like most EU countries and the US. Prominent Islamic countries are probably higher in poverty and subject to civil unrest, lending itself to extremist fringe groups. However, upon further investigation and reading this article: http://www.rand.org/content/da... and http://www.webcitation.org/que... this may not be a valid assumption. According to the study cited by the telegraph, there is no connection between poverty and radical Islam. In fact, poorer individuals tend to have a lower association with radical Islam. The rand study found that actually, terrorist leaders tend to come from slightly higher privileged backgrounds. The final answer, and the one I'm more inclined to believe, is that primarily Islamic countries consist of cultures which readily accept violence, possibly as a result of civil unrest and poverty. An explanation for the previous finding is that educated, wealthy Muslims simply have more means and motivation to pursue violence given the state of their culture.  So, whats my final point here?  My point is sure, not all Muslims are extremist, violent jihadists. However, much more are extremist terrorists than Christianity, or any other major world religion for that matter. Much much more. Therefore, the association of Islam with violence is understandable, even arguable. I won't argue that, simply because I don't know enough about the practices of Islam. But I will say that trying to compare it to radical Christianity is nonsensical. As an aside, I think your first point was the most interesting, that we should take a step back and recognize that the message and the right to say the message are different. However, honestly in a time like this, after suffering the death of 12 innocent people, nobody is going to come out and say "Hey, Charlie wasn't very nice and probably shouldn't have said those things." At this point, the issue is entirely focused on their right to say the message and not the message itself, which is irrelevant to that point. That said, great article and I enjoyed reading it, although I disagree with you in many ways. Keep it up!|~|5|~|Monday, January 12, 2015 12:05 AM|~|1787959388|~|NA|~|1

76673|~|Christian Wawrzonek '16|~|True, great point. But still, this does not change the fact that the number of violent acts from Muslim affiliated groups greatly outnumbers the violent acts from any other religion. Say, 99 percent of violent acts comes from only 10 percent of the Muslim population. I think the size of violent sects within a religion is indicative of the inherent violence of that religion. Sure, the KKK may be just as dangerous. But the proportion of Christian's who identify with the KKK, or any violent fringe sect within Christianity for that matter, is significantly smaller than the number of Muslims who identify with extremist, violent sects, indicating that this is not an integral part of the Christian tradition or religion. As you've shown, oversimplification is dangerous. But my main contention that violent Christianity and violent Islam are not comparable still stands.|~|3|~|Monday, January 12, 2015 2:11 AM|~|1788041179|~|1788036007|~|1

76673|~|Tree|~|Very cute, but let's think a little bit deeper about this. For starters, the KKK was a protestant based organization that practically bathed in the blood and suffering of black americans, catholics, jews, eastern europeans, etc. But what is the difference between the KKK and the modern day extremist cult? The internet and cell phones, also known as the weapons of free speech. Think about that for a second, how quickly can you go to a website on your cell phone? How quickly can you connect to others with both good and horrible messages? All you need to do as a terrorist organization is preach a message to young troubled minds -which there are a lot of in the world- after that you have instant living canon fodder for whatever messed up agenda you have. This gives an inflated value to both the number of extremist groups and crimes when you consider just how easy it is to do now versus back then.

76673|~|Arafat|~|Bringing  other religions down to the level of Islam is one of the most popular strategies  of Muslim apologists when confronted  with the spectacle of Islamic violence.  Remember Timothy McVeigh, the  Oklahoma City bomber?  How about Anders Breivik, the Norwegian killer?  Why pick on Islam if other religions have the same  problems? The Truth: Because  they don’t. Regardless  of what his birth certificate may or may not have said, Timothy McVeigh was not  a religious man (in fact, he stated explicitly that he was agnostic and that "science" was his religion).  At no time did he credit his deeds to religion, quote  Bible verses, or claim that he killed for Jesus.  His motives are very well documented through  interviews and research.  God is never mentioned. The  so-called “members of other faiths” alluded to by Muslims are nearly always just  nominal members who have no active involvement.  They are neither inspired  by, nor do they credit religion as Muslim terrorists do - and this is what makes  it a very different matter. Islam is  associated with Islamic terrorism because that is the association that the  terrorists themselves choose to make. Muslims who  compare crime committed by people who happen to be nominal members of other  religions to religious terror committed explicitly in the name of Islam are  comparing apples to oranges. Yes, some  of the abortion clinic bombers were religious (as Muslims enjoy pointing out),  but consider the scope of the problem.  There have been six deadly attacks over  a  36 year period in the U.S.  Eight people died.  This is an average  of one death every 4.5 years. By  contrast, Islamic terrorists staged nearly ten thousand deadly  attacks in just the six years following September 11th, 2001.  If one goes  back to 1971, when Muslim armies in Bangladesh began the mass slaughter of  Hindus, through the years of Jihad in the Sudan, Kashmir and Algeria, and the  present-day Sunni-Shia violence in Iraq, the number of innocents killed in the  name of Islam probably  exceeds five million over this same period. Anders  Breivik, who murdered 77 innocents in a lone rampage on July 22nd, 2011, was  originally misidentified as a "Christian fundamentalist" by the police.  In  fact, the killings were later determined to be politically motivated.  He  also left behind a detailed 1500 page manifesto in which he stated that he is  not religious, does not know if God exists, and prefers a secular state to a  theocracy.  Needless to say, he does not quote any Bible verses in support  of his killing spree, nor did he shout "praise the Lord" as he picked people  off. In the last  ten years, there have been perhaps a dozen or so religiously-inspired killings  by people of all other faiths combined.  No other religion  produces the killing sprees that  Islam does nearly every day of the year.  Neither do they have verses in their holy texts that arguably  support it.  Nor do they have large groups across the globe dedicated to the mass murder of people  who worship a different god, as the broader community of believers struggles  with ambivalence and tolerance for a radical clergy that supports the terror. Muslims may  like to pretend that other religions are just as subject to "misinterpretation"  as is their “perfect” one, but the reality speaks of something far worse.|~|0|~|Wednesday, January 21, 2015 7:19 AM|~|1805986338|~|NA|~|1
76673|~|ShadrachSmith|~|Terror of offending Islam isn't a method to impose some goal. Terror of offending Islam is the goal, the new reality, that Islam wishes to impose, apparently. Some religions have never advocated violence, other religions gave it up centuries ago. Only Islam regularly practices murder and enslavement of entire populations in the 21st century. Sisi has recommended Islam reform its teaching and drop the right to murder whoever offends them. Obama OTOH, has not. The Democrats in the WH are still calling jihadist murders "workplace violence" and will not name Islam as part of the problem. Why? Obama is leading Democrats in the entirely wrong direction on the issue of freedom of speech. It is time for good Democrats to reclaim the principle of freedom of thought and speech. To do this you must first denounce Obama's tolerance of the evil done by Islam's always present Jihadists, because Islam built this. Students will have to speak truth to power to reclaim Princeton's rightful place as America's bastion of freedom of thought and freedom of speech.

Now, you don't have to tell me how hard it is to find a good shortstop when the roster is in transition between the first series and section 4 optimization parameters, but what really gets me down is the flag-length rule (new for the '15 season) which renders any cross-pitch gallop to be completely unenforceable by law. Talk about ridiculous! And don't even get me started about the chlorophyl reduction gambit perpetuated by West coast teams using a powdered approach to daytime/nightime games; yes, it violates the spirit of the law, but it ruthlessly adheres to the letter, so we should be willing to let bygones be bygones and pass a deep bench up when there is rain in the upper deck.|~|0|~|Thursday, March 5, 2015 2:52 PM|~|1890046431|~|NA|~|0

75439|~|calm voice|~|Newby, you're going to absolutely destroyed in these comments, and perhaps rightfully so. The Michael Brown case is one of the many faces of the protests because the point of the grand jury was NOT to decide whether the killing was justified, but rather to determine if there was reasonable evidence to allow a REAL trial to occur that would allow for a court of law to parse through the evidence themselves. In short, the grand jury was supposed to simply say "Wow, Officer Wilson and some parts of the autopsy indicate one thing, while the witnesses and other parts of the autopsy and the handling of the case say another. We can't decide this without a real trial" and then indict Officer Wilson. The fact that they did not when there was (as I'm sure you agree) such clear confusion about what happened PLUS the fact they allowed Officer Wilson to testify for hours (when normally, according to every leading legal authority in the United States, only prosecuting evidence is allowed) demonstrates the unbelievable failure of the justice system.|~|19|~|Tuesday, December 9, 2014 10:02 PM|~|1734354020|~|NA|~|0
75439|~|Newby Parton|~|Thank you for your comment, Calm Voice. I did not have space to explore the issue further in the body of my column, but, as former criminal lawyer Roger Parloff writes in his column for Fortune Magazine, prosecutors normally don't seek indictment at all if they do not believe the accused is really guilty. This was not a possibility for McCullough given the political charge this case had. Instead, McCullough provided the facts of the case: the autopsy and all witnesses. The grand jury decided that there was not enough evidence to proceed. Reasonable people might reach different conclusions on that point, but the evidence to convict Officer Wilson beyond reasonable doubt is simply not there. http://fortune.com/author/roge...|~|17|~|Tuesday, December 9, 2014 10:14 PM|~|1734365096|~|1734354020|~|1
75439|~|grifhunter|~|Wrong.  The existence of incriminating "evidence" doesn't have to lead to a trial at all if the jury finds THAT evidence unreliable or fraudulent.   Further, evidence has to add up to something, to a level that quantifies as a preponderance in order to indict.   A couple of homies perjured testimony was obviously found insufficient. Officer Wilson's voluntary testimony, in addition to being consistent with the forensic evidence, shows some insight in that he had nothing to hide wherein he could have exercised his right to silence instead of risking testifying. Case was a slam dunk no bill.|~|3|~|Wednesday, December 10, 2014 3:20 PM|~|1735618691|~|1734354020|~|1

That's the sentiment I saw expressed at the protest, and I think it's the sentiment behind pretty much every protest happening around the country right now.  The 45-minute length was probably chosen because there had to be some length and this was the one that most easily lent itself to our purposes - the length had to be defined, and that's a number that has become associated with the movement.  I highly suggest you read some of the materials protestors are distributing and maybe even attend a demonstration - I doubt you'll come away thinking that the main purpose was to dispute the details of the Michael Brown case.  You understand that there is, in your words, "a systemic police and prosecution bias," so I think if you put a little more thought into this issue and do a little more research you'll be able to see how that bias is what people are taking a stand against here.|~|5|~|Wednesday, December 10, 2014 1:18 PM|~|1735404860|~|1734467220|~|0

There are far, far too many cases where the victim of a police shooting is not a threat to the officer, and this must stop.|~|13|~|Tuesday, December 9, 2014 10:02 PM|~|1734353436|~|1734331447|~|1

75439|~|Arafat|~|Demean Garner?  You cannot be serious. == Sources in the mainstream media expressed outrage after a grand jury declined to indict a New York City policeman in the death of Eric Garner, but there are 11 significant facts that many of them have chosen to overlook: 1. There is no doubt that Garner was resisting an arrest for illegally selling untaxed cigarettes. Former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik put it succinctly: “You cannot resist arrest. If Eric Garner did not resist arrest, the outcome of this case would have been very different,” he told Newsmax. “He wouldn’t be dead today. “Regardless of what the arrest was for, the officers don’t have the ability to say, ‘Well, this is a minor arrest, so we’re just going to ignore you.’” 2. The video of the July 17 incident clearly shows Garner, an African-American, swatting away the arms of a white officer seeking to take him into custody, telling him: “Don’t touch me!” 3. Garner, 43, had history of more than 30 arrests dating back to 1980, on charges including assault and grand larceny. 4. At the time of his death, Garner was out on bail after being charged with illegally selling cigarettes, driving without a license, marijuana possession and false impersonation. 5. The chokehold that Patrolman Daniel Pantaleo put on Garner was reported to have contributed to his death. But Garner, who was 6-foot-3 and weighed 350 pounds, suffered from a number of health problems, including heart disease, severe asthma, diabetes, obesity, and sleep apnea. Pantaleo’s attorney and police union officials argued that Garner’s poor health was the main cause of his death. 6. Garner did not die at the scene of the confrontation. He suffered cardiac arrest in the ambulance taking him to the hospital and was pronounced dead about an hour later. 7. Much has been made of the fact that the use of chokeholds by police is prohibited in New York City. But officers reportedly still use them. Between 2009 and mid-2014, the Civilian Complaint Review Board received 1,128 chokehold allegations. Patrick Lynch, president of the New York City Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, said: “It was clear that the officer’s intention was to do nothing more than take Mr. Garner into custody as instructed, and that he used the takedown technique that he learned in the academy when Mr. Garner refused.” 8. The grand jury began hearing the case on Sept. 29 and did not reach a decision until Wednesday, so there is much testimony that was presented that has not been made public. 9. The 23-member grand jury included nine non-white jurors. 10. In order to find Officer Pantaleo criminally negligent, the grand jury would have had to determine that he knew there was a “substantial risk” that Garner would have died due to the takedown. 11. Less than a month after Garner’s death, Ramsey Orta, who shot the much-viewed videotape of the encounter, was indicted on weapons charges. Police alleged that Orta had slipped a .25-caliber handgun into a teenage accomplice’s waistband outside a New York hotel.|~|1|~|Thursday, December 11, 2014 6:47 AM|~|1736584590|~|1735318109|~|1

The police are portrayed by the establishment and the media often as justified in their use of killing -- we have gone past the point of using euphemisms of self-defense, of brutality, this should be seen for what it is: police officers, often white or not representative of the community that they are supposed to serve, are trained to see African-American as threats to be extinguished, or bring institutional racist outlook into the profession with deadly consequences. African-Americans should not have to wonder #IfTheyGunnedMeDown they would be portrayed as thugs -- they should never have to wonder if they will survive an encounter with police. I wonder also if Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old African-American boy, is a corpse sufficiently non-threatening for Newby to rally around.

The fact that there are legal experts who vehemently side with one side or the other suggests to me there was room for parsing through the facts in a trial setting. You commented that the prosecutor was compelled to seek indictment and that prosecutors normally are not forced to do so- but how could a prosecutor feel compelled to indict on his own regard when there are so many conflicts of interests- the fact that he works with this police department day in and day out, his own father's murder.  We do not get to sit back and decide which victims are deemed "worthy" of a cause. In the absence of a video tape people would have picked apart Eric Garner in the same fashion- mismatching statements etc. In the absence of video tape race "mysteriously" predicts who believes what (not perfectly, but the differences are stark enough)- are we to believe that whites are simply more objective.

Hopefully however, the commenters here can look past your lack of tact and rather examine some of the problems that you confront within this issue: 1.) That a quietly sexist mindset exists within these institutional policies that suggests women are incapable of being responsible for their own decisions. 2.) That traditional gender roles are being used to define relationships and interactions that are much more complex than "woman submissive, man dominant." and 3.) That the root cause of many of these drunken actions can be traced to a lack of communication between two partners coming together under an impersonal hookup culture that glorifies an emotionless response to an intrinsically emotional act. While many of us here were offended by your insensitive and tactless confrontation of an emotionally charged issue, I am hopeful that a dialogue might continue that better responds to the very real concerns you raised.

It's much more common for people to defend men in these scenarios.

It'd be brave to speak about this if Coy had anything valuable to add to the debate, which is a real debate about a policy issue. Not every implementation of policy works out as intended, and policy is meant to be scrutinized and amended. No policy is perfect when it is first put into practice.

75453|~|'17|~|People blow false rape accusations way out of proportion. Given the way that many sexual assault victims are mocked, threatened, and shamed after coming forward, I find it incredibly unlikely that many victims would willingly come forward with false rape accusations. The rate of false rape reports is pretty much on par with the rate of false reports of any other crime. Why do you assume that, because of this policy change, many woman will suddenly start falsely accusing men of rape? Also, why do you assume that only males will be accused, and only women will do the accusing? That's incredibly gender normative, and promotes the erasure of male victims of sexual assault. Also, an "issue facing young college men"? There's no issue. There's no epidemic of men being falsely sent to jail even though they were innocent. It's far, far, far more common for an actual rapist to go unpunished. This is the problem that's happening now, the one we have tangible evidence of. It doesn't exist in the realm of the "what if," unlike these fears of women taking advantage of new policies to defame men, with whatever motivation you've imagined them to have for doing so.|~|4|~|Wednesday, December 10, 2014 2:06 AM|~|1734583249|~|1734367667|~|0
75453|~|Vacenza|~|"The rate of false rape reports is pretty much on par with the rate of false reports of any other crime." You have no evidence for this claim.  Just as problematic as the changing in the burden of proof is the increasingly absurd definition of terms like "consent" and "coercion."  Policy terms that are becoming increasingly detached from their literal definitions.  Coercion, for example, is literally defined as "compulsion through force or threat."  But the policy treats "coercion" as a synonym for any kind of everyday verbal cajoling.  As if this someone compels one to do what the other person wants.  Part of this incredibly toxic "women are not really adults" meme that seems to serve as the philosophical cornerstone of 21st century feminism.|~|3|~|Saturday, December 13, 2014 12:00 PM|~|1740400369|~|1734583249|~|1

75453|~|Christian Wawrzonek '16|~|It is not clear and agreed upon, because neither I nor the people I'm speaking to about this in person agree with it. This is the point of me asking you politely if you could elaborate on your point. It is after all your point, so the burden of proof falls on you to prove it, not me. Instead, because you refuse to have an open discourse with me, the discussion is going nowhere, and I will continue to believe what I believe. This is not to say that I am not open to listening to what you have to say. But you have to make your point before I can hear it. I can't presume to know what you are arguing, and then proceed to educate myself on an argument you haven't yet made. Now, because you have hinted a bit about what you meant, I'll try to engage it best I can. How someone dresses should not factor into their right to not be sexually assaulted, on this we agree and most educated people agree. However, I don't think that is a real issue here. The point made in this article is that the burden of proof of rape has been lowered, not that women are to blame because of the rape. The issue is whether or not a rape took place to begin with. Neither I nor Coy would conclude that a rape was justified because a girl was wearing suggestive clothing. To the point of alcohol, that is a shaky defense. People make poor decisions when they are drunk, and women should not be held less accountable for their decisions while intoxicated than men. Let me pause here. Yes, I recognize that forceful rapes occur because women are too drunk to resist or give verbal disapproval. This is obviously not acceptable. Men should not attempt sex with women when they clearly lack the ability to deny consent. The problem is that under the current norm, any level of drunkenness takes the accountability of consent off of a woman. This is one sided. To put it bluntly, if a man gets drunk, has sex and regrets it the next morning, well tough luck. If a woman gets drunk, has sex, and regrets it the next morning, then the man in that situation better watch out.|~|4|~|Wednesday, December 10, 2014 4:07 PM|~|1735706105|~|1735658229|~|1

75453|~|'17|~|It's not, though. When I went to the town hall meeting about the change in sexual assault policy earlier this year, the administrators in charge of the policy change - who have been dealing with sexual assault cases for years - said two things that I think counter this argument. First, they pointed out that the number of false rape reports are often hugely overstated. In reality they're pretty much consistent with the rate of false reports of any other crime. I'm not going to go into reasons why - societal mistrust of women (who made Adam eat the apple?), etc - but people tend to blow false rape statistics out of proportion. It's far, far more common for rapes to go unreported - largely due to the high standards of evidence, which discourage many victims from coming forward. The new standards of evidence are lower for sexual assault than for other University infractions because the nature of sexual assault is inherently different than, say, cheating on a test, where the evidence is written down and tangible. The nature of sexual assault - and how sexual assault victims are often mistreated in society after coming forward - makes it difficult for victims to come forward right away, and even more difficult to undergo medical care that, while providing physical evidence of sexual assault, might cause them further trauma. Second, the administrators said that the change in standard of evidence wouldn't even have affected the outcome of previous cases they've looked at. They said it was "usually pretty clear" whether or not a rape had occurred. People worried that the change in evidence will make the accused "guilty until proven innocent" are completely misplacing their concern. I don't think the accused rapists are the victims here. I think that if we reach a point where more innocent men are being convicted of rape than actual rapists walking free, then we should start to perhaps worry about the rights of the accused. As it is, though, the system is ineffective and allows the vast majority of rapists to go unpunished. I think THIS is the problem that needs fixing right now, not any hypothetical alternate future under this new policy in which boys actually fear having sex with women for fear of being convicted of rape. This is a ludicrous assumption to make based off of a minor change in sexual assault policy that is merely the first step in righting a blatant injustice on college campuses.|~|5|~|Wednesday, December 10, 2014 1:58 AM|~|1734578599|~|1734416461|~|0
75453|~|Steve Swanson '15|~|Do you see how your two points contradict each other? If "sexual assault is inherently different" from other infractions, how is it that it is "'usually pretty clear'" when rape has occurred? That the previous cases adjudicated by the University have been clear and convincing does not imply that there will not be a case down the line in which an accused person is found responsible with just 51% of the evidence. A person found responsible wrongfully will have his (most likely "his")  life ruined for no good reason: a para-judicial body deciding that one is a sexual predator will almost certainly cause the apparent perpetrator to be ostracized and unemployable for the rest of his life. The disciplinary bodies of universities have the ability to destroy someone's life, but not the capacity to correctly punish or rehabilitate sexual criminals. It should not be so controversial, then, to suppose that these bodies should be very cautious in wielding their power and very ready to admit their own limitations.|~|7|~|Wednesday, December 10, 2014 11:53 AM|~|1735262050|~|1734578599|~|1

75453|~|Christian Wawrzonek '16|~|Also, to your point about the threshold at which we question our standards, you are saying that only when the number of innocent accused exceeds the number of actual victims do we stop and reconsider. So long as we successfully prosecute 10 rapists, 9 false accusations are acceptable. That I think is unfair, and completely against the way our justice system works. The point of "beyond a reasonable doubt" is specifically to protect people from false punishment. Prosecuting criminals should not take precedence over protecting innocent individuals. Of course, there is an equilibrium here. It is impossible in any criminal justice system to completely avoid false convictions. The burden of proof that would be required to guarantee protection for innocents would essentially nullify all attempts to prosecute criminals. However, I think half and half is pretty absurd as well. Minimizing false convictions is always the side most heavily favored by institutionalized criminal prosecution, and rightfully so.|~|3|~|Wednesday, December 10, 2014 3:40 AM|~|1734639921|~|1734578599|~|1

This is one of the most common methods of sexual assault. It's not about drunk hookups which, while perhaps lacking in good judgment, do not often fall under the definition of "sexual assault." It's the same as two minors having sex with each other - while technically these minors would be statutorily raping each other, the laws about having sex with minors are more intended to prohibit older people from taking advantage of teens, rather than consensual sex between teens.|~|0|~|Wednesday, December 10, 2014 2:12 AM|~|1734587318|~|1734362173|~|0

It also continues this moronic narrative of 'dude hits on girl, seduces her, he high fives the bros afterwards, she feels ashamed for letting him do that'. Guys want to have sex with girls & girls want to have sex with guys (and guys with guys, etc.). Both have sex. Both can make good or bad decisions. Both can be perpetrators and both can be victims.

75453|~|disqus_mXQvvje9A1|~|Congratulations on being one of the first (if not the first) student journalist from a major University since the U.Va. scandal to actually address the larger due-process issue.  I am extremely dismayed at U.Va.'s students leaders for not having the courage to say what you say.  And I was one of them---Phi Beta Kappa and two-term member of the Student Council.  I am disgusted with my alma mater. I am also an Order of the Coif graduate of Michigan Law School (where U.Va. President Sullivan was the Provost).   The rush to judgment and suspension of fraternity events  with no corroborative evidence is beyond the pale.  Her husband is one of the nation's foremost First Amendment scholars (religious liberties).   The First Amendment---something President Sullivan's husband knows well as I have had the occasion to read his briefs during the time I worked for a U.S. Court of Appeal---guarantees freedom of association. Not only did not the Founding Fathers institute the right to freely associate, U.Va.'s founder led the charge.  No one in a leadership position (at least in public) said we will investigate, but this sounds embellished.  When I went to U.Va., students took pride in the fact that it was hard to get in.  Apparently, it is now even more difficult.  Do the students really have such a low opinion of each other that they would think that nine of them committed such a heinous act?  What kind of community is that? I have reviewed in the adjudicatory process crimes of all sort, including more than 100 rape cases.  The Rolling Stone was more brutal than any of those rape cases. The article read like an activist's fever dream.  It seems like that it was. President Sullivan failed to show leadership here.  And the failure is so antithetical to the Founder's principles, she should go.  By the way, BOV Member Dragas and anyone else from that body that publicly said that the allegations were credible should follow President Sullivan out the door. Leadership is taking right positions not popular positions. Congratulations on showing actual leadership with this column.|~|8|~|Wednesday, December 10, 2014 2:45 PM|~|1735554035|~|NA|~|1

No, these cases have not had "a chilling effect on campus sexual behavior," and yes, the man should get consent when he is instigating a sexual act. However, I do agree that sex between two drunk people should fall on the shoulders of both parties, not just one. Had the male student been sober, I might accept that he raped the alleged victim in this case. But they both willfully had sex while drunk, so they deserve equal punishment. Should both students be expelled? Should neither? As you note, Coy, dealing out punishment unequally is implicitly sexist.|~|8|~|Tuesday, December 9, 2014 11:17 PM|~|1734422574|~|NA|~|1

Any accusation will result in immediate suspension.  It'll take but one corroborating, man hater to remove the guy from campus permanently.  If you're a male teacher - you had better be giving the girls good grades.  If you're a male student, better keep it in your pants or stick to masturbation. Most of you won't believe me - until you see it for yourselves.  Rest assured, you're going to see rape and sexual assault claims go through the roof.  Mark my words.   Same happened with VAWA, the soon to be container of 'yes means yes'.  Once a women need only claim fear as evidence of domestic violence, domestic violence claims and restraining order abuse skyrocketed. Check out the feminist blogs.  They're drooling over the possiblity of zero tolerance.  This is their "prize".  This is their "golden ticket".  Prominent feminists have already stated publicly that the intention of 'yes means yes' is to scare the testosterone out of men when it comes to their sexuality.  Just read the feminist blogs if you don't believe me.  They're literally in a man hating frenzy over this. I can only hope that men adopt feminist thinking on this and report any contact of a sexual nature, not previously consented to, as a sexual assault.

75453|~|Welp|~|They might be taken more seriously if those facts were true... the source of the 1/5 and 1/4 statistics have been shown numerous times to be both flawed in their methodology (the kinds of questions they ask, what they include under the umbrella of sexual assault, etc.) and their scope (the primary one was done on two campuses in the midwest, hardly representative of colleges nationwide). Also, the consequences people are worried about are a lot worse than suspension... While in some cases they may be as low as that, considering the political/social climate today a public rape accusation can, on the one end, result in someone being socially vilified, putting them and their family through the stress, confusion, and pain of dealing with all that comes with that, and on the other can result in years in jail. In the middle, you get kids being falsely accused and kicked out of their university with that on their record, losing friends and severely restricting their educational options moving forward (transferring to another good school would be near impossible) and, consequentially, their entire future. I think that instead of focusing on one or the other, we should focus on both - clearly focusing solely on one or the other will hurt both.

Or enjoy having sex with someone you're not sure would verbally affirm they want to have sex with you?  What are you so afraid of?  If you are afraid she's wouldn't say she wanted to have sex with you, you should not be having sex with her.  "No means No" means all sexual contact is OK as long as a woman does not say (read: scream) "No" and completely fails to recognize that some people who be to terrified to verbalize they do not want to have sexual contact.  Yes is Yes is a significantly better standard.  And seriously, if you cant get this, you shouldn't be having sex.  Also, rape existed Pre sexual revolution.  Look it up.  It may be surprising to you but rape didn't just start 50 years ago.  And while you're at it, you should also examine David Lisak's research on men who commit rape.  Men do not "accidentally" commit rape.  On average, men who commit sexual assault have 5.8 victims.  Their actions are deliberate and systematic.  Spare us your fears of being falsely accused of sexual assault and actual read academic literature (not Jerry Falwell or Sarah Palin) on sexual assault.|~|2|~|Wednesday, December 10, 2014 12:19 AM|~|1734473827|~|NA|~|0

Now, OF COURSE neither I nor Coy supports sexual interaction with an unwilling partner, which would be inherently unsexy. The point here being that a very good portion of sexual interaction is tacit and unspoken. Getting to physically explore your partner and their boundaries is a fundamental part of sex, and this is naturally a game played with our bodies, not our mouths (per se) ;). Having to stop and explicitly ask permission, or having to verbally discuss intentions and plans is inherently not sexy or romantic. There are plenty of Youtube videos parodying this type of interaction. If you, as a woman would prefer a man to verbally ask consent from you, than that's a concession that both parties would have to make. However, I think it is important to recognize that this is not the way sex naturally unfolds, and it would detract from the experience. And no, I'm not saying this because I would like more opportunities to rape women.|~|1|~|Wednesday, December 10, 2014 4:00 AM|~|1734652361|~|1734473827|~|1

74841|~|2010|~|It's not just T.I. or the Eating Clubs. A number of Princeton social groups end up harboring what I would call "casual sexism." You can dress it up as humor, attack people who call you out for it, or just continue to deny it, but there's a real problem with pervading casual sexism at Princeton and it's not just in the clubs. This idiotic shirt is just one manifestation of attitudes that you'd even see in Tower at times, (despite all the gender neutral discussions and movie nights). The comments below only serve to show how blatantly unaware of their own biases some people on campus are. Ridiculing someone for an honest opinion is the basest form of argument.

74841|~|ProfChrisC|~|I was VP of TI in 1982, and its first African American officer. Indeed, I was the first black VP and thus bicker chair among all of the selective clubs back in the bad ole days. Yes, I do see some strands and threads of the sad combo of privilege and immaturity from those days reaching up to 2014 and netting or even strangling the image of what is, in totality, a great club, a great place, a collection of great young people. Thoughtful exposure and discourse can fix that. And, often, a well placed foot in the ass of folks who get out of control and cross the line, or cozy too close to it. Still, I am wondering why TI has become Moby to the Prince's Ahab (or Barack to Fox News, The Weekly Standard et al), when this is too serious and complex a problem on too many campuses, to reduce it to some caricature obsession with an eating club. Indeed, ribald or crazy or sick jokes in a certain context do NOT, alone, create sexual assaults, rape, degradation etc. Should that be the case then we'd better tell the AFI and the Smithsonian to scrub National Lampoon's Animal House from its lists of great and iconic cultural films. Indeed the incidents at UVa, the symbolic protest of Emma Sulkowicz at Columbia for continued inaction on sexual predation, the continued feting and cheering of Jameis Winston at Florida State (and whether he even takes classes) bear more intense review as indications of a terrible problem and a culture that feeds it. Last I checked, TI is not a den of sexual predators and complicit captive female concubines. Last I checked, the horror of predatory nonconsensual sexual behavior, or even beyond that to rape--by violence or threat of violence--isn't happening there. People who were stupid were disciplined. Hopefully other clubs and student instrumentalities from sports teams to organizations got the message. But what more do you want--the situation demanded soap and Purel, not a flamethrower. Over-the-line issues with stupid emails, ribald parties and even RayJ-Kardashian vids can be rectified, and have been. Though again: stupid emails, ribald parties and phone vids aren't the disease. At worst they are a prurient itch by product.    Let's keep our eyes on the larger picture of sexual assault and safety, because I guarantee you all of this weird spot-lit attention and obsession with TI will leave other areas in darkness and unexamined, and that's where predators will truly lurk, and some people are going to get hurt.

74841|~|Alumna|~|"Last I checked, TI is not a den of sexual predators...rape...isn't happening there." -- then clearly, you haven't checked in a very, very, very long time. Also, how do you explain the fact that TI leadership retaliated against the author's complaints by making her the punchline of club-wide joke the following year? NOT ONLY does TI have a culture of sexual aggression, but it then goes a step further and attempts to *humiliate* any woman who dares disagree with them (or who threatens to press charges, in my case) -- even if it's one of their own.  Is that the behavior you'd expect from "a great collection of young people"? Your rose-colored wishful thinking stands in stark contrast to the ACTUAL experiences of TI victims. Are TI members the only ones on campus doing horrible things? No. But it's overwhelmingly "THE" club where this stuff happens; where treating women like objects is the norm. And frankly, they fucking love themselves for it. It's a core part of their branding!  How dare Sally Frank ruin it for everyone? Your "Oh mercy me! I have no idea why everyone is picking on TI!" line is borne of either ignorance or willful deceit. I wonder how many pro-TI posters in these comments are sweating bullets right now because they're worried? They see women increasingly stepping forward (e.g. the Cosby case) and I bet it scares them.  I wonder how many of them have googled "statute of limitations...rape / attempted rape" in the past few days?|~|18|~|Friday, December 5, 2014 2:22 PM|~|1727642910|~|1725729972|~|0
74841|~|ProfChrisC|~|Where is the predation? The rape and sexual assault? If there is an atmosphere then it has been addressed. By example or feet in ass. If there is immaturity (including deriding the author of this original opinion piece) that is addressed by insight and experience. Yet what I see is a  false light the Prince has tried to bounce off and reflect on TI, which fuels this caricature and symbolism, eg the Moby Dick metaphor.  Let me hip you to some reality. Sally Frank prevailed eventually because of one narrow item that all could agree on--and it was NOT that clubs were bad or elitist, or racist or sexist.That was window dressing, that was the frosting and glitter, not the essence. Yes there were and are insouciant folk, racists (overt and coded) and sexist (likewise) tools there and EVERYWHERE on that campus, in this nation. That's America. the prime issue was that the clubs were EXCLUSIONARY. They discriminated against a group of students based soley on their sex, which not only was odious per se, BUT also was depriving those students of the relationships which forge a lifetime network, and depriving the clubs of a body of exceptional potential members who can offer new experiences, talents, points of view. She wasn't out to destory clubs.  So perhaps the key to all of this is that folks within TI and without grow up, get some insight. My advice for you is not to grow up but calm the heck down, for you too are creating this weird Moby Dick thing.  I'm not acting as some sort of troll or TI advocate or Sean Hannity in disguise. Lord knows there are plenty of fanatics and trivial fools taking that role. I'm asking you not to be a fantatic. My glasses, when I wear them and thats a lot now that I am in my 50s, are clear, not rose. I am hoping yours are not green with jade. If anyone in the club system hurt or derided you in the past and that is helping to fuel your stridency, I am deeply sorry and that is why often Princeton eating clubs ALL CLUBS, just like frats etc, can be their own worst enemy thanks to tribalism, but you should not paint TI as some cave of sexist vicious monsters. There are plenty elsewhere out there who are. |~|19|~|Friday, December 5, 2014 3:14 PM|~|1727728578|~|1727642910|~|1

There is nothing wrong with saying "I think what you're doing is rude and it would be better if you didn't." If people were getting arrested for this shit, then we'd have a problem, but they aren't, and nobody is saying they should be. Should they be punished academically? Perhaps, but only after it's been made clear that the university's regulations won't tolerate this shit. And then, if you didn't want to go to a school with a culture opposed to sexual harassment, well, maybe you shouldn't choose this one. And don't cry "academic freedom!" either. "Stuck up cunts" does literally nothing for academic discourse. |~|2|~|Thursday, December 4, 2014 12:51 AM|~|1725335181|~|1725177392|~|0

74841|~|aneilmishra|~|TI has gender issues, for sure, but the reality is that other eating clubs do as well. The difference is that TI manages to get stuff put in writing/email so then everyone finds out about it. Take bicker for example. As much as people complain about how gross (and perhaps hazing) the first day of bicker at TI is, it's certainly better than some alternatives at clubs like Cottage or Cap where people are supposed to tell offensive jokes to certain groups of members or act out sexual activities for the amusement of members. TI's bicker, surprisingly perhaps, is pretty tame in that respect and the costume and trivia nights are not meant to demean or embarass anyone. Does TI make jokes that are inappropriate? Yes, but so do plenty of other people at Princeton. Should girls there be upset? Perhaps, but again they knew TI's culture going in and a lot of it is a joke taken too far but not necessarily a national media crisis (unless taken out of context). So what is the solution? Guys there shouldn't make sexist jokes, girls shouldn't freely put down and hose other girls in bicker, and everyone should just be a little more careful when choosing how to write an email. Other clubs have some serious issues that need to get worked through.|~|1|~|Wednesday, December 10, 2014 12:03 AM|~|1725467036|~|NA|~|1

TI has a right to be tasteless. Many people, including myself, are fine with it. And you have a right not to be a part of it.

Further, while this joke may have been made in a "private community," TI, and any other eating club, does not exist in a bubble and has a clear influence on campus culture. "This article is just part of the greater destructive trend that thinks intellectual liberality means protecting everyone from any sort of offense, and the idea that we can silence people who make us uncomfortable." This 'destructive trend' is less about "silencing" people making offensive sexist jokes, and more about giving voice to oppressed groups who have been silenced for centuries. If you're more concerned about people being called out for sexism than you are about sexism itself, then I think you should reevaluate your priorities.|~|15|~|Wednesday, December 3, 2014 11:32 PM|~|1724874859|~|1724831570|~|0

74385|~|Andrew Frisbie|~|Professor Maynard, I applaud your article and could not agree with you more.  When I chose to attend Princeton aesthetics played a major role.  That and the fact that it was the most academically challenging Presbyterian University were definitely the deciding factors.  On my first visit, I ogled at Whig and Clio halls, fell in love with the Collegiate Gothic architecture of Mathey and Rockefeller colleges and appreciate the both the beauty and grandeur of Firestone Library.  Yet, one aspect that bothered me was the modern buildings including Jadwin Hall and Fine tower which seemed incongruent with the traditional beauty of the main campus.  While not perfect (Alexander Hall comes to mind) the older part of the campus seemed majestic whereas the newer math and science buildings were garish and cold in comparison and the while experts might extol the Butler College as the epitome of Brutalist architecture, I found it abhorrent.  All of this changed for me; however, one night during my junior year when I took LSD and found myself in the gloaming among the Putnam collection staring at the Jadwin quadrangle.  For the first time in my young life I "got" modern architecture.  The beauty of the asymmetrical lines, the way the light played off the imposing structures forming a dark shadow in front of the sunless sky.  It was at this moment that I had full appreciation of the beauty of Princeton's buildings.  Many nights and many doses of acid, mushrooms and ecstasy later, I truly understood Princeton as America's Campus|~|2|~|Wednesday, December 3, 2014 8:31 PM|~|1724747204|~|NA|~|1
74385|~|Verbsap|~|Assuming you’re not writing with tongue-in-cheek, Andrew, I would say that if it takes an LSD hallucination to appreciate modern architecture, then it is a dubious test of aesthetic merit.  Some of the latter-day architects represented on the Princeton campus may have been using controlled substances when they stood at their drawing boards, but most of us who are jarred by their buildings do not have the benefit that you did of being stoned on acid, mushrooms or ecstasy at the time.  If Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds were to stare with her dilated pupils at the wreck of a dump truck, she would also be transfixed by the beauty of its asymmetries and shadows.  So I would say to you: stay clean and stick with Gothic.|~|1|~|Thursday, December 4, 2014 9:53 AM|~|1725434377|~|NA|~|0

73466|~|Guest|~|I would really like to hear what men who catcall think they are doing when they yell things at women in the street.  I have a feeling Steven Santagati is not a spokesperson for all men.  As a woman who has been catcalled, I always thought men did it because it was an easy way to create a power imbalance, to put me "in my place" as a woman who is now vulnerable and open to a man's sexual violation, even if that comes in the form of the gaze (which by the way can feel pretty damn threatening).  But I think only hearing a woman's point of view is limiting.  Men may be intimidated to be truthful about why they catcall (hence why even Santagati would not touch the subject but instead talked about how women think and feel), because they may be aggressively criticized.  But I think it's important for any dialogue to happen to hear both sides, instead of women and men projecting onto each other motivations for their behavior.|~|4|~|Wednesday, November 19, 2014 9:05 AM|~|1701291692|~|NA|~|0

Consider the term "catcalling" itself... idiotic, insulting to women, and yes it is sexist squared. Regarding the fact that a young woman is harassed daily simply because she is traversing a sidewalk in a city, most people understand it has as nothing to do with race or social class, as suggested by the commentator "just tired". The issue of certain men acting in this way has been around forever, but has become intensely coarse and blatant along with the direction of society.

The trouble with the hollaback video is that yet again we see a well-to-do white woman go into an area populated with a lot of PoC of a lower socio-economic class, and then be offended when she isn't treated exactly the same as she is in the culture she was brought up with. Frankly, I'm tired of the thinly-veiled racism racism and classism towards PoC and their culture.

Or is the argument that the women who belong to these ethnic neighbourhoods consider catcalling flattering and acceptable?|~|4|~|Wednesday, November 19, 2014 7:21 PM|~|1702322763|~|1701908494|~|0

New York is more saturated in liberal views about sex and gender than almost anywhere else in the country. Why don't these same feminists take their video cameras and strut around a small town in red America, where conservative, traditional values on sex and gender reign?

The hypocrisy exposed by a supposedly "progressive" city shown as being covered in frankly disgusting forms of sexism is a pretty potent argument for the continued existence of at least some form of the patriarchy, no? When you suggest that the catcalls are unrelated to the patriarchy, you might want to at least provide some sort of evidence to support your claim. (And no, blithely suggesting such a thing wouldn't happen in a red-state town isn't legitimate evidence. Though, as a Bostonian, my experience with the South is admittedly limited, the kinda-gross pop-country songs that chart so highly in those regions which portray women as sex objects who only exist for the pleasure of the singer and his - almost always his - buddies seem to suggest quite the contrary. Try to get through four or more songs randomly picked from the Country Top 40 without running into some form of catcall-glorification and then get back to me.)|~|5|~|Wednesday, November 19, 2014 1:18 AM|~|1700928084|~|1700917601|~|1

Anyone who studied apartheid in South Africa should easily see that Israel bears no resemblance to South Africa. Israeli citizens vote, hold any public office (an Arab even sits on the Supreme Court), enter any profession, use the same facilities and hospitals. The Israeli Constitution guarantees everyone the same rights. South Africa's laws specifically denied equal rights to Blacks. Perhaps Tutu should visit Israel. For all we know, his knowledge of Israel is based on the propaganda he reads on his computer. If you want to act against anti-Palestinian apartheid in the Middle East, start with the fact that every Arab country except Jordan denies Palestinians citizenship. They cannot enter certain professions. Their land ownership is widely restricted. They cannot hold public office, even if they have lived in those Arab countries for generations. Palestinians may not complain so much publicly about this, because it is not politically or financially expedient for them to do so.

The Bedouins face it especially worse, as the resistance village of Al-Arakib has been demolished over 78 times to date. http://english.al-akhbar.com/c... Until Israel is willing to face the music, people of conscience around the world have nothing to say to Israel except #BDS until it meets its obligation according to international law.|~|9|~|Tuesday, November 18, 2014 12:39 AM|~|1705004161|~|1704814956|~|0

This article counters the misconception that BDS is intended to end Israel's existence. I also tried to specify specific measures within the broader BDS platform that I personally support, like the recent faculty petition for divestment. You're right, my culturally Jewish identity is not a main factor in determining my position on Palestine. It does, however, influence my appreciation for the complex cultural history behind Israel and the important reasons why the US must affirmatively support its security and right to exist, through public statements as well as aid. So in that respect I felt that it was worth mentioning.|~|3|~|Tuesday, November 18, 2014 8:37 AM|~|1698690527|~|1698649437|~|1

Then, it goes on to say that in order to balance out the unfair effects of that necessary aid, we must divest. This is forcing divestment onto Israeli companies by virtue of the U.S. helping Israel. This is backing Israel into a corner where they must choose a scenario - we either divest or we withhold aid. This is making a statement for its own sake, and not for the supposed higher end-goal of negotiations. This is not the route to peace.

73324|~|bokmeow|~|Max, I feel sorry for you when I read your so called moderation. With due respect, you have the typical historical Jewish minority, "PLEASE LIKE ME" complex and it is so pitiful to read. Throughout Jewish History especially in Nazi Germany there were those Jews who begged to be accepted and liked by the host country's people. "Like me and I will eat ham for you on Yom Kippur. Like me and I will put up a Christmas tree and call it a Hanukah Bush, like me and I will only pray one day a week, Sunday if you wish (the early German Reformed Jews), etc." The first Jews to be gassed by Hitler were those Reformers ("please like me...") who were viewed as a major threat by Hitler and his Jew hating Nazis. Fast forward to today: Here you are apologizing for Israel who is expected to live a double standard. Never mind the rockets and atrocities implemented by the Palestine people. If you read your history parts of Jordan are supposed to include part of Palestine--the world has convenient amnesia with this one. In the meantime here you are with your "please like me" attitude and no matter what you do they are NOT going to like you. You can stand on your head, eat ham and cheese sandwiches and they are still going to hate you because you are a Jew, period! Look in the mirror and accept that you are a Jew. Say it to yourself over and over and perhaps YOU can accept YOURSELF. Remember, if Israel disappears (the Jewish Host country) there IS NO place for American Jews or the World Jewish community to go in the event of another pogrom, anti-Semitic uprising or Holocaust. If there is another anti-Semitic uprising you are a Jew to these people no matter how much you apologize or try to appease them.|~|2|~|Wednesday, November 19, 2014 1:30 PM|~|1699293596|~|NA|~|1
73324|~|Gregory Weaver|~|I think the writer of this article needs to go to Israel and live for a few years to gain a greater appreciation for the difficulties faced by the Israelis. I understand that you want peace in the region but at what cost? Every time an Israeli company is targeted by the BDS movement it closes up shop in the west bank and Palestinians loose their jobs. This economic hardship only leads to suffering on the Palestinian side and then the Palestinians turn to violence. This violence leads to a more restrictive response from the Israeli government which leads to even louder calls for BDS. Which leads us full Circle. The BDS movement is only breading distrust and trust is the very thing that is needed if peace between the Israeli people and the Palestinians is ever going to occur. It is my firm belief that if outside groups would create every opportunity for the PA and the Israeli governments to interact as well as for the Israeli and Palestinian people to interact with each other we could create the necessary trust capitol needed to achieve peace. Further more from an economic stand point Boycotts rarely work and often have unintended side effects.  For instance take the BDS movement it could easily be turned into an antisemitic group. After all it wasn't the boycott that lead to the fall of Apartheid it was Nelson Mandela. Who is the Palestinian equivalent to Mandela that will ensure that we don't have another Holocaust? All of the leaders of Palestine have at one time or the other shouted "death to Israel" or even better "from the river to the sea". This hardly makes for an environment of trust necessary for peace. As for your equalization response to the military aid the US gives to Israel lets keep in mind that the Muslim states continue to boycott Israel and almost none of them recognize the Jewish state. I would dare say that is equal enough. As for the freedom of movement the Palestinians face. Well if they would quit strapping bombs on their back and walking to crowded shopping malls I would imagine that the Israeli government would allow them freedom to move. How does the Writer of this article propose Israel respond to this? As for the Gaza strip being an open prison. We have prisons in the US and I have never heard of the Prisoners building rockets and then launching them with intent to kill. I mean that would be just ludicrous. So lets just tell Gaza quit building rockets and firing them at civilians then I imagine Israelis will respond more favorably. Often the argument for peace between Israel and the Palestinians is made under the context that Palestinians are Victims and while it is true they have lost much the actions by the Palestinians lead them to even greater loss. had the Palestinians accepted the partition deal in 1948 we would not be having this debate today. Now the Palestinians are trying to make peace with the Israelis under the same premise as 1948 and I am sorry but they had their chance for that deal. It is now 2014 almost 2015 you need to make peace under today's terms. If the Palestinians don't like them well it will be 2016 or even 2048 before you know it and then you will have to make peace under those terms. The same argument I would make to the Israelis as well.|~|0|~|Wednesday, November 19, 2014 4:13 PM|~|1700796748|~|NA|~|1

As long as Israel continues its occupation of West Bank and siege on Gaza according to UN Resolution 242, actively prevents Palestinians from returning to where they were expelled from according to UN Resolution 194, and discriminate against Palestinians with citizenship in the pre-1967 border, the BDS movement will continue to gain steam.

This argument holds true no matter what great power you belong to I.E. China, Russia, India or the EU. So you can have your BDS movement all you want but as long as there is a Suez Canal the US will never do any thing to upset the balance of power between Egypt and Israel.

73324|~|From Israel|~|I hate having to explain foreign policy to people because most are to dumb to grasp even the most basic of concepts; things like balance of power completely allude them. Let alone a sum zero argument. The BDS movement doesn't seem to grasp this. If they think they are going to garner any amount of good will whilst their Gaza and West Bank counterparts are marching in the streets celebrating the acts of terrorist they are out of their minds. Not to mention all the shouts for "death to America" that get bandy about as freely as "merry Christmas" does during the holidays. So BDS gets a college here and a college there to participate and yet these University are rather short sited.  Because sooner or later a Muslim Terrorist is going to get past our defenses and then these University are going to have all sorts of hell to pay.  Max Grear of this article talks about Pluralism as if you can some how reach a reasonable conclusion with groups like Hamas or Hezbollah or Isis or Al Qaeda I mean the list goes on and on and on of Muslim hate groups dedicated to the Destruction of everything not Muslim.  And it easy to say "oh that's not all Muslims" but name one Muslim majority Country that has freedom of religion?  There is only a handful of Muslim Majority countries that have even begun to have something that even resembles a woman's lib movement. Let alone Gay rights. And lets not even get started on the subject of free and fair elections. And free speech will get your head chopped off or tide to a stake and stoned to death or tossed in a pottery kiln. (every one of these has happened in the past two months)  So when you ask me oh lets have a pluralist approach with cultures like this I scratch my head in deep confusion because it doesn't seem like the Muslim culture values multiculturalism and if they don't value that than they sure as hell are not going to value a pluralist approach. And its easy to say that none of this plays into the Israeli-Palestinian peace dialog. But that is completely wrong because every one of these groups have a stake in the out come of the talks. And if any one of them doesn't like the out come of the Peace talks they can and will resort to terrorism. So this goes back to BDS and should Universities support a movement like it and the answer is most certainly not. This group has to many similarities to groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, Isis ect. that to participate with a movement like this is to risk the very good name of the University itself. All for the sake of something that wont work simply because American Foreign policy and more importantly American Military policy will doom to complete and utter failure. A sum negative equation for any University.|~|1|~|Tuesday, November 18, 2014 11:36 AM|~|1704750001|~|1702312476|~|0

73324|~|Open the CJL|~|Incorrect, as Freda Kirchwey amply documented in the May 8, 1948 issue of the Nation Associates, aka 'British Record on Partition': [excerpt start] The facts will show, moreover, that: The British have allowed 10,000 foreign invaders to enter Palestine, offering the feeble excuse that the British armed forces, consisting, at the outset, of over 80,000 men, could not adequately protect the border. Although since December 11, 1947 the British have been promising to return to Transjordan the contingents of the Arab Legion brought to Palestine for police duty, they have allowed the members of that force to remain in Palestine and to attack Jewish communities.  The only conclusion to be drawn is that the Arab Legion constitutes a major part of the effort to coerce the Jews into accepting less than the Jewish State granted by the United Nations. At no time has the British government, in spite of its alleged impotence, requested any help from the United Nations; in fact, as the record shows, the British have continued to deprecate the situation, refused to identify the invaders, and have consistently denied that the Arab states as such are involved. Through their action they have admitted into Palestine Arabs of known Nazi allegiance in command of the invading forces, and have even admitted escaped Nazi prisoners of war, now to be found in command of Arab detachments. [excerpt end] Why are you telling lies with the objective of inciting Jewhatred and portraying Jews as greedy land thieves?|~|6|~|Tuesday, November 18, 2014 7:31 PM|~|1699640685|~|1699554395|~|0

It was not because I think BDS leads to a more 'pluralistic' answer to the problem. It was because BDS (especially anti-settlement divestment) is rational (albeit misguided and harmful IMHO) and therefore should be allowed into the conversation. I also didn't want the CJL staff speaking in my name without my permission. Max, you posit here that BDS directly contributes to pluralism. I don't know what you mean by that. I don't think anyone does. BDS is one specific strategy to solve a specific problem, i.e. the settlements. BDS does not make Israel more pluralistic. It has nothing to do with 'pluralism'. BDS is an economic solution to a political problem. That is what BDS is. It may work (as a version of it did in South Africa). It may not. I'm of the latter opinion, but I'm willing to have that discussion. Including BDS in the discussion is, maybe just maybe, 'pluralistic'. BDS has nothing to do with pluralism. What I think you mean is that BDS is a balancer. It rebalances the Israel-Palestine debate away from Israel. That's not what pluralism means. Pluralism is about allowing many people with many different ideas to coexist, and get along. Don't use 'buzzwords' like pluralism just to get people to nod their heads.  1- Make an argument for why the occupation is bad (easy enough),  2- then make an argument for how BDS helps end the occupation (hint, its not because it punishes Israel or is an expression of Justice. Make an argument about why it'll work.)  3- Then, by focusing on #2, prove to others that this isn't about singling out Israel, and is instead purely what you think is the best way to solve #1.|~|1|~|Wednesday, November 19, 2014 12:25 PM|~|1700548158|~|NA|~|1

MLK and civil rights leaders led the Montgomery Bus boycotts against the Jim Crow segregation, United Farm Workers and Cesar Chavez led the United Farm Workers boycotts for fair farm worker wages and treatment, the boycott against South Africa against Apartheid, and Palestinians' own proud history of boycott against the British colonial power in Palestine. History has shown them to be successful models for demanding change, and so will BDS.

Liberalism, writ large, is the ideology that supports liberty (hence the name): liberals in the classical sense are those who try to restrict government authority from impinging on the freedoms of the people. In short, then, you fault the "socially liberal, fiscally conservative" for misunderstanding their ideology precisely because you misunderstand their ideology. Because you associate liberalism with "social justice," you can't seem to imagine a person who would both support gay rights and not support universal healthcare, or one who would be for marijuana legalization and against expansion of the welfare state.

But if you are correct that there are people who do not agree that everyone should have access to healthcare but at the same time do think that people have some rights (eg freedom from arbitrary arrest, to marry a person of either gender etc), then this doesn’t explain away the problem but actually makes it even more stark: if the definition of a “right” is something that attaches to everyone in principle, regardless of contingent circumstances, then how can the question of whether it costs money be determinative of whether something is or is not a right? One way of restating the author’s argument, if I understand it correctly, would be to say that if you believe that are inalienable rights (and don’t believe that all rights are trumped by the right to private property!) then it is irrational to prefer the cheaper rights to the more financially costly ones.  Social liberalism, as defined in the article, is defined by belief in certain rights.  So coupling it with fiscal conservatism is for this reason irrational. Side note: you don’t have to agree with the argument, but I’d make sure that you have a really good old crack at trying to understand fully what an author is saying before you start accusing them of a shallow understanding of the issues.|~|2|~|Tuesday, November 18, 2014 2:53 PM|~|1700016882|~|1699678253|~|1
73358|~|Steve Swanson '15|~|I appreciate your response. Your restatement of the author's point certainly does present a valid tension: if one believes in a fundamental, abstract rights political theory, then this person would be renegers of their own philosophy if they fought to secure only the fiscally cheaper rights. However, in order for the author's point that "SLFC" is fundamentally paradoxical to be legitimate, she has to assert that all people who ascribe this label to themselves believe not just in abstract fundamental rights, but in the certain abstract fundamental rights that she decrees to be "socially liberal" (e.g the Right to Welfare and the Right to Healthcare). I won't go into the positives and negatives of an abstract rights-based political philosophy here, but suffice it to say that not every self-described liberal does hold the beliefs that Ms. Sakha declares to be the social liberal orthodoxy. There clearly can be a social liberal who doesn't believe that healthcare is a Universal Abstract Fundamental Right, but who believes that the government should not be in the business of policing, say, sexual morality. I would, then, take your final "side note" and address it to Ms. Sakha, wholly unedited: by maligning a swath of people based on her own rigid definitions of their self-proclaimed ideology, she does more harm than good.|~|5|~|Tuesday, November 18, 2014 3:50 PM|~|1700108553|~|1700016882|~|0

73358|~|Steve Swanson '15|~|I'm glad that you responded -- I really appreciate you taking the time to further the conversation surrounding this issue. Let me start by saying that I do regret taking such an ad hominem approach: it was unproductive of me to adopt such a condescending tone. Rather than casting aspersions on your understanding of the meaning of political terms, it would have been better for me to criticize the ideas and argument put forth in the article. That being said, the main reason that I was so quick to jump to an ad hominem and condescension was your own tone throughout the article: the characterizations of self-described "socially liberal, fiscally conservative" people are unequivocally negative, waving away their identification as a "fad" and a "pretense for the incognizant and/or apathetic." The implication that the ill-defined bulk of "SLFC" people only identify as such because of their lack of education or interest is certainly insulting. Webster defines "to malign" as, "to say bad things about (someone or something) publicly." This definition, I would say, fits your article: the piece does not merely disagree with the SLFC, but considers them to be indifferent and uneducated. The thesis of the article -- that SLFC is a paradoxical, self-contradictory title -- is also based around a misconception of the definition of social liberalism as discussed earlier. Even cursory searching around the Internet would have given examples of the variety of beliefs to which social liberals can ascribe. One should be very careful when accusing others' beliefs of being definitionally inconsistent, and I say this because I've made similar mistakes in the past. It is now my personal policy to consider what others say to be presumptively correct: rather than jumping on a perceived flaw, I look at every possible semantic interpretation of the words that have been said, and assume that the correct one is what was meant. For instance, if someone says, "I'm a democratic republican," I would realize that these words mean more than just their contemporary party connotations, and take their meaning as it was likely intended, rather than assuming that they hold contradictory views Finally, a key problem with this and other Prince columns is that it doesn't really spend much time defining with whom it is disagreeing: you give a vague sense that there is a group of people out there calling themselves "SLFC," but then attribute characteristics and views to them based on nothing (at least nothing explicit) except your own sense of who they are. I know that this is not an academic paper and we cannot expect MLA citations, but a reference to another article, an event, even a conversation you've had that conveyed the perceived apathy and misunderstandings of the SLFC would have gone miles to further the argument. I've written a lot about this article at this point, and I hope what I've gotten across is productive. I appreciate your willingness to discuss this and get to the bottom of our difference in opinion.|~|8|~|Wednesday, November 19, 2014 7:14 PM|~|1702315399|~|1700126822|~|0

Western liberal expectations of "good healthcare" would probably collapse India's economy if India tried to implement a universal healthcare system. Conversely, 100 years from now, the level of healthcare that we think of as advanced will presumably be very basic. If you want to argue that healthcare is a right then you need to ditch the "regardless of contingent circumstances" bit.|~|3|~|Tuesday, November 18, 2014 7:04 PM|~|1700511147|~|1700016882|~|1
73358|~|or_pick_a_name|~|""This juxtaposition of social liberalism with fiscal conservatism is a  glaring paradox. It is impractical and unrealistic to fully seek social  liberalism — gay rights, the legalization of marijuana, a welfare state,  universal healthcare — without big government, without spending,  without taxes, without fiscal liberalism..... Myriads of people associate social liberalism merely with “letting gays  marry” and fiscal conservatism with “lowering taxes for the rich.”  However, these two ideologies connote more than that. Social liberalism  is the belief that champions the alleviation of poverty, the expansion  of education and universal healthcare. Fiscal conservatism is a policy  that opposes deficit spending and supports the reduction of the national  debt and overall deregulation of the economy."" The problem here is that you have a very restrictive view of libertarianism. Yes, it would be a contradiction for someone to support high spending and low taxation. However, the way you state these opinions does not allow for nuance and variation. For example, one might be more liberal in certain sectors (for example, welfare) and more conservative in others (for example, defense). Secondly, your insistence that liberalism and conservatism necessarily follow a rigid set of doctrines is similarly restrictive. I don't think it's unreasonable for someone who favors personal liberties (gay marriage, drugs, etc) to consider themselves socially liberal even if they don't support expanding welfare, etc. - it may not be precise terminology, but it does follow the current conventions. Generally, I think the issue is that most people who call themselves SLFC don't follow a strictly party line set of doctrines - and that's the whole idea. I agree that you can't be purely socially liberal and purely fiscally conservative, but if you pick and choose from both sides, you can make it work. Ultimately, though, SLFC is really shorthand for "I support social causes but I understand that nothing is free". It's called being a moderate.|~|23|~|Tuesday, November 18, 2014 11:16 AM|~|1699592109|~|NA|~|0

So is welfare a social or fiscal issue? This contradiction highlights the failure of this argument, namely the conflation of egalitarianism with social liberalism.  This definitional failure is also highlighted when she says "social liberalism refers to the compromise of freedom in search for social justice and greater civil liberties."  How can it be compromising freedom to get more civil liberties (which is freedom...). It's totally possible to believe the government should not regulate our social lives (pro-gay rights, anti drug war) while not believing the government should spend a lot of money trying to force social equality.  This is what being a libertarian means, and it's frankly more philsophically tenable than being either a straight up democrat or republican.|~|11|~|Tuesday, November 18, 2014 11:51 AM|~|1699679513|~|NA|~|0

73358|~|JPeron|~|I fear Ms. Sakha does know either history or philosophy. The  origins of liberalism were in the dual view of social and economic freedom, not in the big government view which came out of the conservatives defending church/state alliances and the feudal order. I personally think the big government view she promotes is conservatism. Of course, after decades of liberals fighting for a free society—socially and economically, a "middle-way" or third movement sprang up. It argued we could have the goals of liberalism by using conservative means. Instead of reducing state power, as liberalism had done, they wanted to embrace state power. The whole feudal order should be taken over and used to further "liberal" goals. That third movement was socialism—a hybrid movement that used the iron fist of conservatism. That is fundamentally the same strategy Ms. Sakha is proposing. Imagine the attempt to secure "freedom of speech" while having to buy paper from state bureaucrats, or have licenses to print, and permits to distribute books. Freedom of speech also requires freedom to buy property, own property and sell it. Depoliticized markets are necessary to achieve "socially liberal" goals. It is no accident that the private sector was already granting equal benefits to gay couples long before the first state government was willing to do so. The private marketplace was already producing gay books, gay magazines, social venues for gay people, while the entire political establishment was passing laws trying to close those venues, regulate those books and make it a crime to be gay—something that remained true in every state until 1961. Depoliticized markets created the climate that made the "Gay Liberation" movement possible, while Ms. Sakha much-loved big government was gay bashing from sea to shining sea.|~|9|~|Monday, November 17, 2014 11:21 PM|~|1698592059|~|NA|~|1
73358|~|pb123|~|A simplified version of liberalism and conservatism is that conservatism means stauts quo, while liberalism means going forward (which is why it is called progressive). Pre 20th century liberalism meant small limited government, and freedoms for all (however it really meant for white male Christians at first). This is why the Founding Fathers were considered radical liberals of their times for wanting a huge progressive step forward (in their eyes) with a small limited government and more emphasis on the market. Post 20th century, after rights and freedoms were pretty much universally distributed, the progressive view switched to a larger federal welfare-state like government. At the time, the government was small compared to the market, so smaller government was considered conservative. Today, our government is much larger than before, and it is why it  is called progressive, while smaller government activists are seen as conservatives. In today's terms, our "radical leftist Founding Fathers" would be in the rightmost outliers of the Tea Party.|~|0|~|Wednesday, June 3, 2015 11:26 AM|~|2060007438|~|1698592059|~|1

"Socially liberal" views, really, are conservative. The belief that the government should not infringe on personal liberties such as marriage, abortion, or even drug use, is a conservative concept. Moreover, Obamacare does not represent a failure to reconcile these viewpoints, even if you are hell bent on characterizing the social views involved as "liberal" and the fiscal views as "conservative." In that case, Obamacare falls well within the fiscal sphere, not the social. The Affordable Care Act is about who pays for what, not about social liberties. If anything, the contradiction there lies with people who self-identify as both socially and fiscally liberal who, for example, think that the government should have to pay for their heart medication (ACA), but that Bloomberg's large soda ban is unconstitutional.|~|2|~|Tuesday, November 18, 2014 7:30 PM|~|1700546705|~|NA|~|1

History proves there is no correlation between the two in practice. Social conservatives took up the rhetoric of fiscal responsibility to attack certain ideologies, groups, and policies, but they never actually supported fiscal responsibility. Someone can be socially liberal and even fiscally liberal while also being concerned about responsibility in various forms. But I shouldn't be too hard on the author. She is merely expressing typical American attitudes.

Under this view, it is obviously impossible to be SLFC. However, a different (and probably more complete) view of politics has two axes: an economic left wing/right wing, and a liberal/authoritarian view (check out the  politicalcompass.org ). I think the author would agree that Stalin would be the exact opposite of SLFC, given that he supported huge government and wasn't so keen on personal rights. Given this example of someone who doesn't fall neatly into the single axis spectrum, perhaps the author may acknowledge that a niche for SLFC people exists?|~|0|~|Sunday, January 4, 2015 1:37 PM|~|1771541555|~|NA|~|0

Princeton, and other elite schools, have a major problem with recruiting first-generation students. Nationally, 50% of students are first generation, compared with the 13.4% at Princeton this article cites. I think it would be a smart move of Princeton to be one of the first upper-tier schools to open a center like this, and then publicize it everywhere it can. Also, I do think that it is important to point out that these centers are not uncommon at community colleges and lower-tier universities, where low-income students attend in greater numbers. A center like this would be a step in the right direction if Princeton wants to attract talent from a wider applicant pool.|~|1|~|Friday, December 12, 2014 4:11 AM|~|1738247854|~|1698244061|~|0

Or maybe their parents will be infected by this anti-rich sentiment and just give it all away.

73152|~|Aardvark Smith|~|Your article doesn't address the broader point from the earlier article that the existence of highly paid jobs that are relatively little taxed is predicated upon there being lots of very poorly paid jobs.  It is completely understandable that you personally want a high-paying job - no one is denying that many people want such jobs! - and that you want to support your family.  But this doesn't get around the argument that the existence of jobs which allow a single adult to support several other adult family members to a very high standard are part of the system which means that those other adult family members cannot live well on non-1% jobs and/or state benefits. That is, the argument is not all wall street workers want to keep their money only for themselves and not share it with their families (this is obviously false), but that the massive income gap (plus harmful behaviour by the wall st institutions and misguided public policy) creates poverty for many as well as great wealth for a few.  And it would be nice if Princeton students could direct their efforts towards changing this rather than perpetuating it, thus improving life not only for their own immigrant grandmother but for immigrant grandmothers the country over.|~|17|~|Monday, November 17, 2014 5:14 AM|~|1696965615|~|NA|~|1

73152|~|'15|~|Hi Aardvark, this is the author.  Thank you for replying to my article.  I understand what you're saying, but in the article I do articulate that it is important to give back (i.e. work to fix the income gap) once in positions of power. A point that is not explicitly articulated in the article, but which is implied, is that students such as myself understand that the success and well being of those around us is actually beneficial to ourselves.  My grandmother is dead, so I will never be able to improve her life.  But I can improve the lives of others who come after me, people I may never meet or know.  It is this type of attitude and perspective that is important for fixing the income gap, yet it is so often not expressed.  I would love to discuss this more with you if you would like, so please feel free to email me:  yarroyo@princeton.edu.  I'm glad this has sparked discussion, thank you.|~|4|~|Monday, November 17, 2014 12:47 PM|~|1697660853|~|1696965615|~|1
73152|~|Aardvark Smith|~|I understand that you are not saying that you want to keep all the wealth for yourself, but I still think that you are being naive about the idea of giving back. I also completely support the idea that if you are not coming from money you are going to have to work for a living.  But seriously, it is not like the only two options available for  Princeton grads are working for wall st and living as a trust-funded mime artist in the meat-packing district.  Yes, clearly, many of us are going to graduate with some debt and need to think about paying that down.  But that doesn't need we need to earn $100,000 year by the time we're 23! I reject the notion that the upward mobility of "working class" individuals into "1%" jobs is beneficial for American workers as a whole.  OK, you're breaking the way for people from "non-traditionally professional" or maybe even "non-wasp"  backgrounds to enter "elite" professions.  But for most poor Americans, it isn't that they could be working for Goldman Sachs were it not for prejudice, but that they are only qualified for a minimum wage job and a minimum wage job doesn't pay the  bills. How does you working for GS help a minimum wage worker?  Are you going to lobby for a living wage inside GS?  Are you going to lobby for GS to stop investing in sub-prime markets that depend upon the bankruptcy of the poor and ignorant for their profitability, while working for GS?  How can you do this when (1) GS is a publicly traded company and therefore has a legal obligation to maximize profits for its shareholders (and it is illegal for it to take into account ethical concerns about the people whose homes it is repossessing) and (2) everyone in the business is fully on board with the idea that the free market is king, and you will get ostracised for mentioning politics?  How are your colleagues going to react when you write an op-ed in the NYT proposing a 50% income tax on wages above $100,000? This idea doesn't seem well though through to me: I can't really imagine what  situation you're thinking of when you suggest that working inside financial organisations could be a "position of power" from which it is possible to effect change.  I can only imagine that you've been to a GS recruitment event, and they've mentioned how they sponsor a high school debate team in Queens and are totally into giving back to the community.  Ok, I hate to break it to you, but these "giving back" initiatives?  They're just marketing. Clearly, there's no easy answer, but is bolstering the position of the elite really the way forward?  I recommend you take a look at Piketty's book Capital if you  haven't already.  I've found that (Princeton alum) Michael Lewis' books on wall st and John Lanchester's books and articles in the London Review of Books (free through princeton computers) on finance have been really insightful too.  Most of all, I recommend you exercise some cycnicism when you hear bankers come onto campus and tell you about how they are totally socially responsible.  Think about their interests -- they don't coincide with the present-day equivalents of your grandmother, so why would helping them help her?|~|11|~|Monday, November 17, 2014 5:49 PM|~|1698162902|~|1697660853|~|1
73152|~|'15|~|You make many assumptions here and I'm not sure where you are getting them from (why do I want to work for Goldman Sachs?) and I think you are really not listening to what I am saying. Princeton graduates will probably go off to join the one percent, can't do much about that.  But what if those graduates were actually committed to "giving back" in the way you envision it (I am not sure what your vision of that would be, but lets just say they want to do that).  If the people in positions of power (again, whatever that means to you) are suddenly super committed to affecting change, don't you think that could make a difference.  Maybe your answer is no but I would love to hear your reasoning for that and what you think a better approach would be.

73152|~|Aardvark Smith|~|I was using working for GS as an example of a 1% job, but insert whichever one you choose (I am presuming that to enter the 1% you have to enter investment banking or hedge funds -- are you thinking of other industries?).  My point is that once you are within a large organization like GS it becomes difficult to lobby for social change in favor of working people because your interests are no longer aligned with those of working people and your success within the organization depends on promoting the interests of the organization and that of your peers.   Honestly, I can't really imagine what specific examples of social change do you think you will be able to effect once you are working for such an organization?  Because I really don't think that it is possible to remain an i-banker/hedge fund manager/etc while promoting controversial political positions.   I don't think your social position in the organization would be tenable.|~|3|~|Monday, November 17, 2014 7:02 PM|~|1698281632|~|1698196705|~|1

73152|~|'15|~|That question is an important one and I apologize that I didn't understand that this was what you were getting at before.  I don't pretend to be an expert but I do not think that the interests of a large financial corporation are counter to those of working people.  In fact, I think it is the exact opposite.  As I said in another post, the economic health of the other 99% is actually beneficial (possibly even essential) to the well being of the other 1%.  Exploiting the system for the benefit of the few is not sustainable.  I am sure this view has been expressed elsewhere and I apologize that I cannot direct you to a specific article (perhaps someone else who reads this would be kind enough to lend help here).  But I think that your position assumes that the only way Goldman Sachs can be a successful and profitable corporation is with the large income gap we see today, which I simply do not believe is the case.|~|1|~|Monday, November 17, 2014 7:17 PM|~|1698318946|~|1698300609|~|1
73152|~|Aardvark Smith|~|Ah, well clearly I disagree with you here.  Piketty's recent book is pretty damning on this view in my opinion.  And I guess if I was being flippant I'd say that if wealth trickles down anyway, there's no need to enter the 1% in the first place...|~|1|~|Monday, November 17, 2014 7:28 PM|~|1698332398|~|1698318946|~|1
73152|~|'15|~|Interesting point, but do you think that wealth trickling down hasn't worked because those with money are not actually "giving back" in a way that would matter (i.e. outside of purchasing power)?  I will take a look at Piketty's book, thank you for this reference.  Also have you seen Robert Reich's documentary "Inequality for all?"  I'd be interested to hear what you think about it.|~|1|~|Monday, November 17, 2014 7:35 PM|~|1698340331|~|1698332398|~|1
73152|~|Aardvark Smith|~|Only if by giving back you mean an 80% income tax on top earners!  But in gen I think that people are less likely to advocate for such measures if they enter the 1%--it's clearly against their personal interests.  But otherwise, I think capitalist practices cause and entrench inequality, so no I don't think that there's any way they can be 'offset' by outreach work or similar.   And I don't hold out any hope for our generation being any different from previous ones with regard to will to change society, so if the trickle down effect hasn't  worked yet, I don't see why it should in future.  But good luck to you anyway; and I'll check out the Reichs doc, thanks xoxo|~|1|~|Monday, November 17, 2014 7:54 PM|~|1698365238|~|1698340331|~|1

73152|~|ghost|~|Where are the highly paid jobs that are "relatively little taxed"? No job for a Wall Street firm would fall into that category as it's all W2 income. I'll pay north of 40% in federal/state income tax this year... my self-employed wife will pay nearly 60% (as a result of paying the employer portion of payroll tax).. believe me, if there were a good way to avoid paying so much, I would have found it. Tax rates are quite progressive in the US - this is a good source if you actually question this point:  http://taxfoundation.org/artic... . Also, another point: the biggest source of wealth inequality in the US is the Federal Reserve's policies of manipulating equity markets / ballooning its balance sheet / holding rates low such that companies buy back debt to drive EPS growth at the expense of CAPEX. The benefit of that accrues almost entirely to the top 1% who are the largest investors. Perhaps you could start there?|~|0|~|Tuesday, November 18, 2014 8:59 PM|~|1700712288|~|1696965615|~|0

While I understand that your family worked hard to get you here, understand that the culture here makes it seem like money is all that matters. This is the situation that I face. Would I love to be involved with public service for the rest of my life? Sure. But the way that Princeton's culture paints public service is that it doesn't pay well enough. Realistically, for somebody like us, you will earn more than enough to live on. You will earn enough to be able to afford taking care of your family, especially if you save properly and manage your money effectively. You don't have to make $100,000+ annually to be able to afford housing your family. Don't let Princeton's informal "wealth culture" get to you to the point where you sacrifice doing something that can be both emotionally and financially rewarding because it isn't as financially rewarding as finance.|~|5|~|Monday, November 17, 2014 3:44 PM|~|1697963098|~|NA|~|0
73152|~|'15|~|Hi WWS, thank you for this comment.  I understand your frustration with "wealth culture." Of course, not everyone comes to the same conclusions that I do when they try to reconcile their career choices with their past and their search for personal fulfillment. Some may come to the conclusion that they cannot be fulfilled unless their career coincides perfectly with their inner goals, whatever those may be. That is fine, perhaps a career in public service is where you will find your peace.    I am not prescribing anything here, just describing a perspective.  I think it is important to remember that as a Princeton student you do have the luxury to choose to go into public service or a lesser paying job, it is not thrust upon you by necessity for a paycheck, which is a beautiful thing.  More people should know that freedom.  Figuring out what personal fulfillment means to you is a personal discovery, there is no one-size-fits -all.  We are very lucky to have the freedom to figure that out.  I would like to direct you to my conversation with Lynda B.  Perhaps you may find more clarity of my position there.  Once again, thank you for your comment.|~|0|~|Monday, November 17, 2014 4:18 PM|~|1698029484|~|1697963098|~|1

73152|~|Lynda B. |~|Do you think most low-income, first gen students are motivated by familial responsibility? I wonder where's the balance of that responsibility and that of own personal fulfillment. Low-income students may often feel that burden to lift up their families, but there should be a balance between that responsibility and personal fulfillment. This is where universities can do more in helping students find that balance. Many schools currently fall short in supporting first-gens, which can make these decisions more overwhelming.|~|1|~|Monday, November 17, 2014 2:11 PM|~|1697801547|~|NA|~|1
73152|~|'15|~|You are right Lynda, there should be a balance.  I do not know how many low income first generation students feel motivated by familial responsibility and I won't attempt to quantify that.  However, I am not the only person who feels that part of my personal fulfillment is derived from taking care of my family. I, as others like me may agree, know and accept my role in the greater scheme of things. My function in the material world is to realize the socio-economic evolution of my family and to help those around me, and working toward that is fulfilling because I am at peace with that calling.  Yet it is also very important to realize that the game we play in this material world is secondary to the development of who I am inside (spiritually, emotionally, intellectually). Colleges can play a better role in helping students to develop these two worlds and bring them into communion with one another.|~|4|~|Monday, November 17, 2014 2:28 PM|~|1697836261|~|1697801547|~|1

I wish there were more people talking openly about these issues. We need more voices like yours.

Many equate personal fulfillment with their career (I'm not sure when or why that has happened), but I don't think any job can truly fulfill me, I don't think anything outside of myself can do that.  Fulfillment really does come from within, and that journey looks different for each individual.  I love that you have pointed out the lack of attention society gives to this kind of development.

73152|~|My name is Jeff|~|I don't think you're wrong about seeking just high-paying jobs. But I think what you're missing is what high-paying job you're taking. Most people object to jobs on Wall Street, for instance, not because they're high-paying but because there's a sense of jobs on Wall Street requiring you to do bad things. For instance, JP Morgan was recently in the news for intentionally hindering investigations into the "London Whale", which has prevented the relevant authorities from either prosecuting those responsible or preventing that sort of financial crime from being done again. If JP Morgan were to pay you highly to do something unethical (like the example mentioned above), would you still feel comfortable invoking your family's poverty to justify your working there? Probably not. On a side note, thank you for writing a good column, and responding respectfully to comments in the comment section.

Conservatively assuming that there are 500 Jewish undergraduates at Princeton, this implies that you got about 7% of the community to sign this petition. No institution can ever hope to achieve total consensus when undertaking significant actions, but 93% is pretty damn good. I am happy that the CJL is responding in the fashion that it has, and an overwhelming majority of our community seems similarly pleased. When ~93% of an institution's constituents favor a policy, that institution should rightly feel entitled to act on behalf of the entire constituency. There will always be an implacable minority, and that minority should not unduly constrain action.|~|17|~|Wednesday, November 12, 2014 5:55 PM|~|1690382859|~|NA|~|0

Instead of trying to justify the CJL's actions through some crude majoritarianism, a majority by the way this letter clearly demonstrates is a fantasy, you ought to feel compassion towards your colleagues who are being silenced and marginalization by a community they love. This isn't about numbers or percentages, it's about the meaning of community and the deplorable conflation of Jewish identity with a particular political orientation.|~|59|~|Wednesday, November 12, 2014 6:06 PM|~|1690395688|~|1690382859|~|1

72761|~|Jew'15|~|Okay, I will grant your point about students demurring-- let's say that an additional 14 students would have otherwise signed the petition but for fear of repercussions. That brings this petition's support to ~10% of the undergraduate Jewish population, so I am not sure how you come to the conclusion that this majority is a "fantasy." I do sympathize with those who feel that their views are being marginalized within CJL, but such sympathy need not trump the wishes of 90% of the community. The last I checked, "crude majoritarianism" is what we like to call democracy and has been the most legitimate basis for group choice for the past two centuries. The CJL is not silencing these students, but merely acting to reflect the greater interests of its community as defined by an overwhelming majority of that community. No one is saying you cannot articulate these views in the CJL. The only claim is that, at the institutional level, the CJL ought to oppose pro-BDS views.|~|5|~|Wednesday, November 12, 2014 6:18 PM|~|1690409467|~|1690395688|~|0

Obviously there are some people who neither support nor oppose this letter. That's probably the majority of Jewish students actually. A lot of people don't care about these issues. That gets lost in the back and forth. So the fact that 7% of Jewish undergrads support this letter actually says nothing about the remaining 93%. If I got 100 Jews to sign a letter saying they like ice cream, does that mean all remaining Jewish undergrads do not like ice cream? Shorter version: 7% of Jewish undergrads saying they believe something is not equivalent to 93% of Jewish undergrads saying they don't believe something. Lots of Jewish undergrads probably would not sign this letter or its opposite, because they simply don't care or are unsure of their beliefs.|~|6|~|Thursday, November 13, 2014 11:34 AM|~|1691432892|~|1690409467|~|1

There is no reason to oppose Jewish residency in Judea and Samaria, and many resons that would support that right.  After all, would these students view as not extreme a petition directed at the residency of Arabs in Israel, or Christians, or Bahai?  Not only did Jews live there - and not on ancient Biblical times but up until the major Arab-instigated violent ethnic cleansing operations under the British Mandate and then during the 1948 war with over 20,000 Jews were expelled from Gaza, Nablus, Hebron, Jerusalem's Old City, the four kibbutizm of the Etzion Bloc as well as Bet HaAravah and the moshavim of Atarot and Neveh Yaakov - but there is a quite specific internationally legal right to reside there found in Article 6 of the League of Nations Mandate decision, still relevant as per UN Article 80: "The Administration of Palestine, while ensuring that the rights and position of other sections of the population are not prejudiced, shall facilitate Jewish immigration under suitable conditions and shall encourage, in co-operation with the Jewish agency referred to in Article 4, close settlement by Jews on the land, including State lands and waste lands not required for public purposes."  The territory then was all of what these students would call Israel and the West Bank.  These students go against history, against Jewish rights and against human rights not to mention extending moral assistance and hope to the most violent and extreme of any nationalist group in the Middle East that consistently employed terror since 1920 not as a tactic and not as a startegy but as an identifying character trait of their nationalism, see Article 9 of the PLO Charter: "Article 9: Armed struggle is the only way to liberate Palestine. Thus it is the overall strategy, not merely a tactical phase. The Palestinian Arab people assert their absolute determination and firm resolution to continue their armed struggle and to work for an armed popular revolution for the liberation of their country and their return to it....".|~|8|~|Thursday, November 13, 2014 2:11 PM|~|1690951131|~|NA|~|0

Not to mention that the Pentagon clearly determined in its own 1967 study that Judea and Samaria, containing hilly high land areas, are strategic to Israeli survival. Why would anyone want Jews to be ethnically cleansed from these areas and thus much more vulnerable to the attacks by psychotic and sick neo-nazi clerical fascists?|~|19|~|Wednesday, November 12, 2014 9:29 PM|~|1690566947|~|NA|~|0

The Palestinian country, when it is established, should not live in the shadow of Israel - it should be an independent country. Using the same arguments as yours, it will have an equal claim to Judea and Samaria - as those lands have military strategic importance.|~|2|~|Wednesday, November 12, 2014 11:56 PM|~|1690722391|~|1690668971|~|1

It's Israel's land due to the legal rights that were born after WWI, when it was given to the Jews in exchange for the financial support that the Jews had given to the allied cause.   But no need to cry--many Muslim-only apartheid states were also created from the old Ottoman empire. Kosovo actually isn't remotely strategic for Albania's survival.  The US's assistance to the KLA quislings that run kosovo is pretty much the same as its assistance to the quislings of fatah. Geopolitically, the Serbs and the Jews are the same, both victims of Western imperialism and neo-nazi  lies.

There will be no peace until the Arabs quit demanding 'the right of return'. Unfortunately, any Arab leader who signs peace with Israel without that 'right of return' won't live to see the ink dry. 4.

In Hamasistan they will blame all their problems on Israel that way the politicians can line their Swiss Vaults with endless international aid money and not be held accountable. In Hamasistan they will shoot rockets into Israel during rush hour and when schools get out.  That’s the way they do things in Hamasistan.  Then they will blame Israel for making them do it.

It's a important cause, so if you want to make a change, realize that you're attacking the wrong party. Even if Palestinians had their own land and the right to make their own laws, the Palestinian people would have no rights. None. Human rights violations, you say? Until the Palestinians have an educated, tolerant leader, which they will never have under Hamas' oppression, you are just picking on Israel because it's easy. Weigh the benefits that the current Palestinian government provides Palestinians with the harm they inflict on their citizens - the scale will tip in favor of harm. (I'm sure you've read about all the money the Palestinian government used to build tunnels instead of for aid, the videos of Gazan parents letting their kids stand in front of missile launchers, suicide attacks, etc.) Weigh the benefits that Israel provide Palestinians with the harm they inflict - the scale will tip in favor of the good. You don't have to believe me on the last point - the first point is actually most important. If you can open your eyes and see that, there's hope for Palestinians. Preserve your cause, for its a good one, but re-target your attention. Islam at its heart is not a violent religion, but it can be oppressive, and it has allowed extremists to silence peace. Surely a majority of Palestinians just want to live their lives in peace, just want to raise their families normally. But oppression does not come from Israel. Oppression comes from islamic extremists. Until terrorism ceases to be glorified, and until those islamic leaders can value not only a Jewish life but the the lives of their own sons and daughters, you must realize that the fault lies in Hamas. Open your eyes and stop picking the 'easy' battle against Israel. Pick the harder battle against the Palestinian government. It's easy to hate on Israel because the "numbers" and "disproportional measures" seem to be in your favor. Wrong. Wrong wrong. For as long as Palestinian leaders empower their people to "grab his knife" and attack Israelis [1], your snark will have no true value. Meanwhile, I support this petition and I support this piece.

Increased demand for the highest paying jobs (more of us going into finance) would reduce the inequality gap if anything because increased demand for a fixed supply of jobs would allow wages to go down, at least in theory. 2.) GDP=Consumption+Investment+GovernmentSpending+(Exports-Imports). You assume that the reduced consumption caused by concentrated wealth is bad for our GDP (destroying our "backbone"), but you fail to realize that where that diverted consumption goes, into investment, also contributes to GDP. Additionally, increased investment relative to consumption would probably also lead to greater GDP right now because we currently have an inefficiently high consumption rate and low savings (investment) rate 3.) Take an econ class. 4.) You're probably going to regret this article when you decide to apply to finance jobs junior year.|~|2|~|Monday, November 17, 2014 2:23 PM|~|1697820620|~|NA|~|0

72362|~|Sorry, but|~|You say that Princeton grads (and assumedly any grads) who seek a job on Wall Street are laying the groundwork for a stock market crash? I don't see the logic there. Speculative bubbles are not caused by unempowered new hires, they are caused by investors who are bullish about the market. By the time a Princeton grad has enough clout to cause a speculative bubble, he's a seasoned investment manager whose mere longevity in the business has proven his passion for Wall Street, so the "do something fulfilling" speech is like preaching to the choir. You say that the wealthiest 400 can only buy so many cars, certainly not as many as the bottom 150 million. Well you got me there, but it should be noted that the wealthy typically don't have just one car, but that is neither here nor there. The point is, the wealthy spend their money on a hell of a lot more than cars. They spend their money, gobs of it, on travel, entertainment, services, etc...which, by the way, are industries in which workers from the bottom 150 million make their living; thank goodness the wealthy continue spend in these sectors. Further, it would be interesting to know how much the wealthiest 400 have donated to charity vs. the bottom 150 million. You say that by going after the 1-percent jobs, grads are increasing the inequality of wealth distribution; this simply isn't true. These jobs don't disappear if the Princeton grad doesn't take it, it just goes to the Columbia grad. And it is not very likely that many if any of them, despite making a very comfortable living, will become wealthy enough to affect the wealth distribution curve. Your disdain for students who are seeking high-paying jobs is confusing; shouldn't we all be seeking the best for ourselves? I'm sure that you could have attended any number of universities. Certainly you didn't choose Princeton because you love New Jersey; weren't you simply seeking the best for yourself? Nothing wrong with that. Your argument is really a philosophical one, and also an econo-political one. So you don't like capitalism, you don't like greed, and it sounds like you believe the two words are synonymous. Socialism of sorts feels better to you. You are entitled to that opinion and thank you for sharing it in a well-written piece. I just think that your view is very idealistic, through rose-colored glasses. No matter how many Princeton grads turn down Wall Street jobs, that machine will keep churning. It is the foundation our financial system and without it, world markets would crash. I believe that Wall Street NEEDS the best and brightest from Princeton and from universities across the country.

You can't have it both ways. If you want to address issues facing black and Hispanic graduate students, that's fine. You have a perfectly legitimate case. But then please don't use all inclusive and blanket terms unless you are willing and able to represent Asian students' perspectives, issues, and concerns. It's a generalization, and frankly, marginalizes, in this small way, Asian students (Not meant to be compared to or trying to "one-up" any marginalization of any other group. Not trying to start an oppression Olympics!). As a side note, this sort of phenomenon plagues discussions of inclusivity and diversity in general, and is not unique to this op-ed.|~|12|~|Wednesday, October 15, 2014 10:41 PM|~|1638374854|~|NA|~|0

I completely agree that Asian American students should be included in the larger definition of "minority" students, as should other traits and identities. Princeton, however, has explicit --  and extremely outdated -- definitions that it continues to use when addressing issues of diversity. The article reflects those definitions. This is just one of the many problems with the way Princeton conceptualizes and treats diversity that need to be seriously re-thought as the university moves forward.|~|10|~|Thursday, October 16, 2014 12:25 AM|~|1638466374|~|1638374854|~|0

Why invest such energy in reforming a place that is not home, and where you will not be staying? Use the (excellent) resources, make the contacts, take advantage of the letterhead, and face the fact that you need to publish, and get out. In my sadly extensive experience, having seen generations of grad students struggle with Princeton's chilly unresponsiveness, it's invariably the conspiracy-minded and the irrationally-entitled who cling and moan and want to be treated like junior faculty. You are not junior faculty. You are here to learn certain behaviors and responses. This is not a nest. How many times do I need to say it?

To allow students the opportunity to finish their programs without dropping out and make it better for future students of color? That's just one response. I don't think these graduate students want to be treated like junior faculty, who also deal with these issues; I think they want to have an experience that is equivalent to graduate students who are not of color and who do not come from marginalized communities.

Further, I don't see anything unfair in that I will be paid less than STEM majors. If I wanted their jobs, I would be a STEM major do. Salary in an economy is dictated by what people are willing to pay for that person's contributions. Have you spent more money supporting bands and authors than you've spent buying laptops, cell phones, electricity, transportation, even toilets and sinks? The truth is that engineering labor benefits society more than at least 90% of humanities-related labor, and I am willing to pay more for these greater benefits to my life. You're right, however, that technology should not diminish the humanities in any way. If an author like John Green writes novels that really add value to my life, I'll buy his books and posters and movie tickets. In this respect, society still values humanities highly.

What if they could not find an occupation in that field... or some other circumstance forced them to pursue something outside their major? Again, your assertions are altogether misleading by overgeneralizing. b) Your use of 'many' needs to be qualified because statistics show the opposite. In fact, many of these STEM majors end up in fields outside of their study. c) I was a WWS major myself. I do not believe this school and field of study was or is meant for students to major in just as a shortcut to becoming future bankers.

I'm saying it's not unfair that STEM majors have better employment prospects, in response to this line: "First, people in humanities fields do not make as much money as science, technology, engineering and mathematics majors. This, although it may not be fair..." Although he hedged himself, I'm pointing out that it is in fact completely fair for this to be the case. It's not like Princeton forces certain people into certain majors, and people do know this. Everyone (here at least) has equal opportunity to these majors, and that's completely fair. We're agreed that value isn't only judged by money, but I'm saying that it's not unfair that STEM majors have better employment prospects because it is fundamentally a choice to do STEM or not.|~|1|~|Wednesday, October 15, 2014 2:19 AM|~|1636412274|~|1636385969|~|0

It's not segregation or discrimination. I'm sorry if you feel people are asking questions insensitively, but they're not asking maliciously. Gently correct them if you feel you must, but don't get offended by it. With regards to the second half of your essay, yeah... it's not really there. You just ask questions based on not much knowledge. The Fields Center has historically been a black/minority enclave on campus. Ditto with Ivy, but privileged white enclave. Colonial is really Asian, for whatever reason. And Cannon selects specifically for athletes, who are generally more black than the rest of the student body. By the way, if you want a clue as to why there's so much segregation on campus, why not look at the proliferation of cultural groups, which specifically exist to establish segregated friend groups?

70520|~|bundist|~|This response may seem reasonable, but it is not. It is calm and formally respectful, but these are not always signs of truth, nor is anger a sign of falsehood. Rabbi Roth (I will assume she wrote the letter and the others just co-signed) is correct, of course, in criticizing Professor Weiss for speaking about his "right" being infringed. But the response is incorrect in ignoring the important  questions and problems that rise from this case: 1. Given the drastic shifts, documented by Beinart and others in respectable publications and accepted by many experts from all sides of the political spectrum, in the attitude of younger American Jews towards Israel, can the CJL hold on to its policies and still claim to represent and serve the Jewish community on campus in general? CJL was the result of the visionary Rabbi Diamond, who believed in a very pluralistic version of the Jewish center; now that increasing numbers of American Jews are not Zionists or even anti-Zionists, does it make sense to exclude these groups by promoting Israel as a central value? Israel can remain of course part of the center's mission, like traditional Jewish law. But just like the center accept those who violate or even oppose Jewish law (a much more important value in the Jewish tradition then Israel has been or ever will be), so should be accepting of those who oppose the state of Israel, as long of course as they do it non-violently (and disengagement in the form of a boycott does not count as violence). 2. While this is happening, Harvard has hosted a very popular and successful conference on "open hillel," the movement to get away precisely from the model about Israel which the CJL has chosen here as it aligned with National Hillel. Why is Princeton lagging behind when other schools are moving forward? This is particularly troubling since Princeton is in a better position, given the resources CJL here has from the University, to declare independence from Hillel. 3. The policy of "boycotting the boycotters" may have made sense when BDS was a fringe movement. Does it make sense now when mainstream academics, including a large number of Jews and even a significant number of Israelis, support it? Does it make sense to count those people – many of whom have fought for Israel on the battlefield and in the diplomatic spheres, many of whom are intellectual leaders of Judaism –  among those who "intend to harm Israel or promote racism or hatred"? Many, many supporters of BDS believe that it is the best thing to ensure the future of Israel (though of course many do not). 4. The University offers substantial support to the CJL in part because of its pluralistic approach. If tenured members of the Princeton faculty are counted, in the eyes of the CJL, among racists, should the University continue to offer its support?|~|16|~|Tuesday, October 14, 2014 12:37 PM|~|1635250823|~|NA|~|0

And a brief added comment to the ’16 guest who wrote, “pressure the state of Israel into ending its continued hostilities against Palestinians in Gaza and the West” – it is clear (and most unfortunate, in my opinion) that you are highly biased AGAINST the country of Israel and its citizens and your comparison/analogy to actions of the Russian Federation is both abhorrent and has zero basis other than clear prejudice against Israel. And while I have little doubt you will come back at me and others and spew more “Anti-Israel” sentiments, these types of attitudes are one of the key reasons that the CJL on Princeton’s campus not only had the right to act in the manner it did, but the RESPONSIBILITY to do so on behalf of the community it serves and represents. Again, thank you CJL for standing your ground despite pressure by those such as ‘16 guest who would surely prefer that both the CJL and Israel “back down” against those who would like exactly that.|~|6|~|Tuesday, October 14, 2014 3:51 AM|~|1634642815|~|NA|~|0

SJP (or PCP) or anti-abortion groups are nothing like the CJL in terms of its organizational level and relation to the University (Roth is a chaplain employed by Princeton which is a fairly high rank, the CJL gets a building from PU etc –– nothing of the kind is true of those groups. We remain with the Women's Center. If that Center has rejected speakers who are experts on gender issues tenured by Princeton University, or has implied that women that go against one theory or another in women's policy ought to be excluded even though such women constitute a significant group among Princeton women, then it should be addressed in the same way.

70520|~|bundist|~|I am a Jew and love Israel. I agree with you that MW has no "right" to participate in a panel sponsored by the CJL (as I wrote below). And yes, every group on campus has the right not to include a speaker (though note that here it's not so much that they decided not to include him, it is that they said they will withdraw support from the event if he is included as other students wanted, which is something quite different). I have problems with the CJL both as a Jew and as a member of the University community. As a Jew, this organization is supposed to speak for me as well for other Jews, yet if we are non-Zionist, anti-zionist or if we support BDS, it does everything it can to exclude us (to varying degrees – non-zionists and anti-zionists by constant emphasis on Israel; BDS people with outright exclusion) . This is unwarranted, especially given the changing landscape of Judaism in America. My Jewishness and Judaism are some of the most important things to me – why should I feel left out from a place that purportedly serves me? And why should my University support this exclusion? If CJL wants to be "The Center for Zionist Jewish Life" or "The Center for Israel-Centered Jewish Life," they definitely, as you say, have the right to do that. But then the University should come up with resources to support a more inclusive environment for Jewish culture and life. That will too bad, since one of the nicest things about Jewish life in Princeton is the way that it is centered in one place (with the exception of Habad, a development I didn't like). I wish it would stay this way, but Rabbi Roth is making it impossible, and I just don't see the gain. It sorrows me greatly.|~|6|~|Tuesday, October 14, 2014 2:37 PM|~|1635521417|~|1635499712|~|0
70520|~|leucippe|~|dear bundist, (autocorrect wanted to change this to 'bandit' but I resisted.  I appreciate your response and respect your opinion in this regard.  I wonder at a couple of things?  how about other religious organizations on campus?  Have they been under fire for choosing their programs and its participants?  I understand the plight of a secular Jewish student like you (assuming 'secular') and wonder whether in fact you have attended other events at CJL, whether you go to Shabbat dinners, for example.  To demand that CJL provide a neutral, value-free atmosphere for all Jewish students is perhaps a utopian dream (and by the way, Chabad has some very good things to offer) and even unfair.  I myself am fervently opposed to the BDS folks -- their ignorance, their hypocrisy, and much more.  You need not support Israel; you may deny it the right to exist; but because CJL does support it, it does not mean that you cannot otherwise participate in the Jewish life it provides students under the wonderful, empathetic leadership of Julie Roth.  Count yourself lucky.|~|1|~|Tuesday, October 14, 2014 3:15 PM|~|1635581043|~|1635521417|~|1
70520|~|bundist|~|Dear Leucippe, Thanks for the consideration and for not succumbing to auto-correct! :) I have attended many events in CJL, but as my political consciousness became more developed, and as CJL continued to respond to various events in a way that I found really offensive to me and my friends, I went less and less. (And I go to chabad sometimes too – I didn't mean to say they don't have nice things to offer and I think very highly of Rabbi Webb. I just meant that there was something nice about one single chaplaincy... in a way it acknowledged diversity to me more than having two). Of course CJL can't be "value free": that's not what a religious organization is supposed to do, and of course (in response to your other question), that other religious organizations are allowed to stick to their values. My question though is why does Israel need to be such a central, and sometimes even "red line" value in a community which increasingly includes Jews who really don't identify with it? Is contemporary Judaism so poor in values that we will be "value free" without Israel? Why for example do we need a picture of Ben Gurion and an Israeli flag in the CJL? Would CJL accept a donation of a framed engraving of 18:22 or of the blessing, "Blessed is He, who has not made me a woman"? Of course not, because it would be offensive to Jewish LGBTs or women, even though these texts have been part of the Jewish tradition more than Israel has ever. Why can't we recognize Israel is similarly divisive? You, and Rabbi Roth, can definitely object to BDS, and I don't agree with it either. I'm sure some of them are ignorant and hypocritical, but are so sure that all of them are, that we will not sit with them and have them in a sukkah to discuss and fiercely debate what is good for the people, as we have been doing for centuries? They include not just my personal friends but also prominent Israelis and Jews. Do we really want to go this way? What do we gain by this?|~|1|~|Tuesday, October 14, 2014 3:35 PM|~|1635615100|~|1635581043|~|0

I won't repeat the arguments about the demonization of Israel as the sole objective of those who would deny its legitimacy or even existence.

It's not clear whether he is saying that  it didn't happen or that if it did then the Palestinian Arabs do not share in the guilt and are innocent of any involvement in it.  Assuming he does not dispute its existence as an event, then he and many others are ignorant of the fact that certain Arab leaders took part in it and are  thus guilty. To begin, Jews in Arab/Muslim lands were long subject to religiously mandated oppression, persecution and humiliation in those. They were dhimmis who lived not by right but because they paid a yearly head tax [on adult men] to the Islamic dominion. This same status, the dhimma, also applied to other non-Muslims. See what ISIL is doing right now to non-Muslims, Christians and Yazidis,  and to non-Sunni Muslims, the Shiites.  Against this background, Arabs took part in the Holocaust in several ways.  1)  murdering Jews in Arab/Muslim lands, as in Iraq, Egypt and Libya. Consider the 1941 Farhud pogrom in Baghdad, Iraq. More Jews were killed in that event [estimates range from 179 to 600] than on Kristallnacht in Germany There was no State of Israel at the time.

70323|~|Arafat|~|CrookedStickGooseSteps, Islam is indeed a crime against humanity, and its first victims are Muslims. I think that is why Muslims are so quick and ready to assume victimhood. On a subconscious level, they feel victimized, but in their search for the cause of their discomfort they incorrectly identify colonialism, crusades, Jews, racism, and so forth as the cause. For a Muslim to face up to the reality of Islam and to admit to oneself that Islam is the problem means to lose one’s identity. Hence the cognitive dissonance Muslims experience when Islam is called into question. Hence the scrambling for excuses and explanations that can convince the Muslims themselves that Islam is not the problem. And the explanations tend to be colonialism, crusades, Jews, racism, and so forth. When cultural Muslims refer to spurious arguments by Islamic apologists as a counterargument to brush aside direct quotes from the Qur’an and the hadiths, it is not that they are deliberately trying to to deceive the non-Muslims. They are desperately clinging to the hope that Islam is not the problem. When they repeat the talking points of Islamic apologists explaining how Islam is a religion of peace, their primary aim is to convince (delude) themselves and make the cognitive dissonance go away at least momentarily, which then removes the immediate threat to their identity and postpones the inevitable confrontation. Unlike most of the Muslim world, Turkey is a country where, thanks to militantly secularist strains, there are more Muslims who are not completely enslaved by their Muslim identity. That gives slightly more breathing space for the individual to break the chains of Islam. Nonetheless, it still means you have to turn your back on large parts of your cultural heritage and family. Families in any culture have members who seek to enforce tradition. In Muslim cultures the conservative members of the family are enforcers of Muslim identity, which brings along with it the whole can of worms that is the Qur’an and the hadiths.|~|4|~|Monday, October 13, 2014 8:04 AM|~|1633147461|~|1632730657|~|1

The only place in the world where ethnic cleansing and genocide is a constant is in the Muslims world:  Sudan, Somalia, northern Nigeria, the Copts of Egypt, the Chaldeans of Iraq, the Kurds of Turkey, the Bahia of Iran, the Hindus of Pakistan, the Shi'ites of Saudi Arabia and the Sunnis of Iraq... Meanwhile, in Israel, the Muslim population has grown exponentially since 1948 and you call this ethnic cleansing and genocide.  Why do you hat Israel so much as to accuse it of horrors it is clearly not guilty of perpetuating?

You religious relativists are good for nothing other than muddying the water. Mohammed stole, raped, enslaved, tortured, screwed countless women (including a nine year old girl), and brutalized countless people.  Christ did none of these things.  He did the opposite of Mohammed. Islam is as different from Christianity as night is from day.  This does not mean that Christians act in accordance with Christian principles as we all know this is not the case.  But when Muslims commit violent jihad in the name of Allah, when Sharia law demands infidels be treated as chattel or be killed, when the Qur'an demands followers to spread Islam by whatever means is necessary then any and all of this is considered sanctified under Islam. If you cannot distinguish between good and evil then you are beyond reason.|~|0|~|Monday, October 13, 2014 7:29 PM|~|1634170050|~|1634162011|~|1
70323|~|Yechiel Gordon|~|Correct. It was the Muslim governments of Europe who fought World War One and killed 29 million Christians. It was the Muslim Prime Minister David Lloyd George of Great Britain who supported Hitler as a good "bulwark against Communism" and it was Germany's Muslim Church that signed the Concordat with Hitler and supported his crimes. Hitler was raised in a mosque and therefore Christians are exempt from criticism regarding the 40,000,000 deaths resulting from WWII. It was the Muslim President of the US, Harry Truman, who killed 400,000 civilians in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Muslim presidents Kennedy, Nixon and Johnson killed about 3,000,000 people in Indochina and Muslim elements in the CIA installed Saddam Hussein in Iraq and the Shah in Iran; the Muslim MOSSAD of Israel trained the Shah's notorious SS-style SAVAK police. On September 11, 1973, Muslim practitioner Henry Kissinger had Chile's democratically elected leader, Salvador Allende killed, and a Nazi style dictator installed. Israel's Muslim Prime Minister Menachem Begin bombed Iraq's Osirak reactor and kickstarted the Iraqi nuclear program. In 1982, Israel's Muslim leader Ariel Sharon carpetbombed Beirut and killed 20,000 people. Muslim Zbigniew Brzezinski trained Osama bin Laden and rewarded bin Laden with millions of dollars of US tax money after he successfully murdered 22 schoolchildren. Later, Muslim president Bush invaded Iraq with the support of his Muslim Congress and killed about 1,000,000 people there while deploying depleted uranium. His Muslim father, George Bush had worked closely with the leader  Saddam Hussein and provided him with satellite reconnaissance necessary for gassing his Kurdish enemies. It is clear that Muslims should be the focus of our criticism: Those Muslims! Wow, they sure are violent and hypocritical, aren't they?|~|6|~|Friday, October 17, 2014 1:27 AM|~|1640146342|~|1634170050|~|1

When Muslims become jihadists and kill in the name of Allah that is what their religion encourages and rewards.  It is also in accordance with what their prophet did and encouraged as well. In contrast to this your list is a hodgepodge of events reflecting men making poor decisions or decisions made in desperation.  These decisions are not based on a common religious ideology as has been the case with Islam's relentless march towards a worldwide caliphate - a march that dates back 1,400 years and has resulted in some 20% of the world's population adhering to a repressive, cruel ideology that abides by no individual freedom.|~|0|~|Friday, October 17, 2014 7:19 AM|~|1640447086|~|1640146342|~|1

This vileness, combined with the ideology of nationalism, has been incorporated into the ideology of our favorite mass murderers since the time of Columbus, whose "experiment with the native population" was, of course, greatly admired by Hitler, and whose memory the US government honors with a national holiday each year. The very partial presentation of Christian and Jewish mass murderers which I provided for you, rather than constituting a hodge podge of "poor decisions," is a list of purposeful decisions made with the consistent intention or willingness to sacrifice human beings on the altar of Greed, Hatred and Ignorance known as Patriotism. A complete list would fill volumes and would implicate every US administration since WWII and each of Israel's successive post 1967 terrorist governments -- all of whom have abided by the racist notion that the Lord's Chosen Jews have a right, and even an obligation, to take the land and the lives of the indigenous population of the region. The list I provided you then, is precisely the history every serious Jew, Christian or non-hypocritical supporter of Israel will take to heart and work to rectify before presuming to criticize others. |~|4|~|Friday, October 17, 2014 7:42 AM|~|1640469762|~|1640447086|~|1
70323|~|Arafat|~|Yechiel,  Good point.  I'm sure you will agree with the following: I’ve got a novel idea. Let’s do nothing. Let the Muslims deal with their own problems (ISIS being the latest) for a change. Let’s let countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait with their endless ocean of money and Western-bought armaments figure it out instead. Surely they – being practitioners of the religion of compassion and peace – will step right up to the plate in our stead. OK, you caught me there. You knew I was kidding! You knew what I know which is that there is no answer to these Islamic cesspools. Whatever we do will be discredited and if we do nothing then Syria will become just another country in the endless line of Hell on Earth Islamic countries. We cannot save Muslims from themselves. It is like trying to save an alcoholic. Until they are ready to abandon their religion – a religion that emphasizes aggression and violence and sadism – anything we do will simply be a band-aid on a gaping wound. Let them go through their DTs on their own. Only then will they be ready for our friendship and help, and only then will we find a way forward together as friends.|~|0|~|Friday, October 17, 2014 7:46 AM|~|1640473085|~|1640469762|~|1
70323|~|Yechiel Gordon|~|I agree. Rather than supporting the most repressive Muslim governments such as Saudi Arabia, the US and Israel should end their association immediately. This is not doing nothing, but, rather, demonstrating that we are moving away from our perpetual war for our terror. The development of an ISIS-like entity was the predictable result of the US invasion of Iraq, and was in fact anticipated by the planners who advised George Bush. In other words, Bush was advised that an invasion would not decrease Islamist terror, but would increase it. As oil, not terror, was the real concern, he invaded. Thus, ISIS. When the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, the US did not want to do nothing, so Ronald Reagan began inviting Taliban leaders to the White House and giving them his Christian assistance. Later, the CIA did not want to do nothing, so it started training nice people like Osama bin Laden to kill schoolchildren, and this he did. Later, Osama turned on his previous masters, and we know the results of that. Incidentally: the tactic of hijacking civilian airliners was first brought to the world by Moshe Sharett and his Israeli collaborators. Later: Blowback. Later, Bill Clinton and friends ignored Iraqi proponents of democracy and helped kill 600,000 kids via an embargo designed to bring to power a new dictator who would take orders from the US. So yes, the first step the US can take toward stopping terror is to stop supporting it. No kidding.|~|4|~|Friday, October 17, 2014 8:33 AM|~|1640521800|~|1640473085|~|1

Was this also America's fault and Israel's fault? Don't you get it?  Can you not connect the dots?  The common denominator, Yechiel, is Islam, is jihad, is caliphate, is infidel... === Gregory Palamus of Thessalonica on Islam "For these impious people, hated by God and infamous, boast of having got the better of the Romans by their love of God...they live by the bow, the sword and debauchery, finding pleasure in taking slaves, devoting themselves to murder, pillage, spoil and not only do they commit these crimes, but even - what an aberration - they believe that God approves of them.

But let me be clear, let me state this upfront, and let me refute your ill-founded opinion that I hate Muslims for this is not a trivial accusation.  I do NOT hate Muslims.  But I do hate their religion.  Muslims are, in fact, Islam’s first victims and are to be pitied for it.  Islam crushes their ability to spread their wings. To create and be creative.  To embrace differences and to embrace others . As I wrote earlier I am entitled to my opinions and you to yours.  You tell us this conflict is not about Islam expansionism.  I tell you it is.  You tell us this conflict about the “application of human rights and international law” and I tell you it is about a religion, and its adherents, for whom  “the application of human rights and international law” are mocked.   Be it in Sudan, Syria, Somalia the “application of human rights and international law” are ignored.  Be it in Pakistan, Afghanistan or Turkmenistan the “application of human rights and international law” are meaningless.  Be it through shooting rockets during rush hour, blowing up buses filled with women and children, slitting babies throats and then naming streets and village squares for those who commit these crimes the “application of human rights and international laws” are a joke. Now it is your opinion that Islam plays no role in this conflict.  That Jihad plays no role in this conflict.  That the Islamic tenet of building a world-wide Ummah plays no role in this conflict.  You are entitled to this opinion.  I grant you that even if it flies in the face of reality. Hamas’ leaders and Imams quote the Quran in justifying their Jihad against Israel.  So do Egyptian Imams, as well as Jordanian, Saudi, Sudanese and Bahraini Imams.  You choose to ignore this as if irrelevant.  I do not. Egyptian media and schools depict Jews as “sons of apes and pigs” (a direct quote from the Quran), as does the Iranian media and schools, as do those in Pakistan, Malaysia, Yemen and elsewhere.  Now you choose to believe this has no bearing on the conflict.  You are entitled to your opinion as I am to mine. Mohammed and his men beheaded more than 600 Jewish men and boys when they conquered the village of Qurayza.  The Jews refused to accept Mohammed as their prophet and Islam as their religion and paid their lives for doing so.  This set the stage for today’s conflict.  You may call this hyperbole and ridiculous even though I can link hundreds of videos, Muslim newspaper articles and the like referencing this history as an example for what Muslims must do today.  These are their words, their prophet's words and just as Mohammed and his followers wiped out the Jews of Qurayza so are Palestinians determined to do today.  Their bloodied prophet is their role model.|~|3|~|Monday, October 13, 2014 4:08 PM|~|1633867052|~|1633851899|~|1

70323|~|P11|~|In July 2012,  IsraelNationalNews.com  enumerated several vital facts reflecting J Street's consistently anti-Israel posture. These included the following: J Street’s political action committee (PAC) receives funds from the Saudi Arabian embassy’s attorney, Nancy Dutton. J Street receives more than $10,000 per year in contributions from Genevieve Lynch, a director of the National Iranian American Council, which is a pro-Iranian lobby. J Street’s PAC has received tens of thousands of dollars from one of the leaders of the Arab American community, Richard Abdoo. J Street's PAC repeatedly took contributions from a Turkish American, Mehmet Celebi, who had helped produce Valley of the Wolves, a viciously anti-American and anti-Semitic Turkish film. J Street recently sponsored a speaking tour for John Ging, head of the Gaza-based UNRWA, an entity whose raison d’être is to perpetuate the Palestinian refugees’ status, thus encouraging their “right of return.” J Street’s visit to Israel in February 2010 was co-sponsored by an anti-Israel group called Churches for Peace in the Middle East, an organization which supports the boycott, divestment, & sanctions (BDS) efforts against Israel. Anti-Israel U.S. Arabists are attracted to J Street, sitting on its advisory board or contributing to J Street’s PAC. These include Ray Close, former CIA station chief in Saudi Arabia and then advisor to the head of Saudi intelligence; Lewis Elbinger, State Department foreign service officer; Nicole Shampaine, director of the State Department’s Office for Egypt and the Levant; Ted Kattouf, former ambassador to Syria and the United Arab Emirates; Robert Pelletreau, former ambassador to Egypt, Tunisia and Bahrain; and Philip Wilcox, former U.S. consul general in Jerusalem, and president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace. Daniel Levy (Jeremy Ben-Ami's partner in founding J Street) stated at a conference in Abu Dhabi that “the creation of Israel” was “an act that was wrong.” Levy also defended the Goldstone Report, which was very critical of Israel’s 2009 military operation in Gaza. J Street welcomed BDS lobbyists to its national conference, where BDS ran a session on strategies and justifications for boycotting Israeli products. In January 2012, J Street in Jerusalem held a special meeting to honor Israeli soldiers who refused to obey the orders of their commanders. In March 2012, J Street lobbied the U.S. Congress against a resolution condemning the blatant incitement and anti-Semitism in Palestinian schoolbooks and the Palestinian media. Moreover, J Street refused comment on the Palestinian Authority's school curriculum which openly promoted the violent struggle to "liberate" all of "Palestine."|~|38|~|Sunday, October 12, 2014 10:28 PM|~|1633148447|~|1632868149|~|0
70323|~|concerned person|~|The headline and much of the language in this article is highly misleading. Based on a close read of the article, it looks like the CJL merely declined to co-sponsor the event. The CJL did not "veto[]" Prof. Weiss's "right to participate" in a panel on Gaza, nor did the CJL "bar a faculty member from sharing his expertise and perspective." The CJL did not prevent the panel from happening. The panel could have been sponsored by many other organizations on campus. Why should the CJL be expected or required to spend its limited budget providing a platform to those who advocate a boycott of Israel?|~|14|~|Sunday, October 12, 2014 10:48 PM|~|1632692052|~|NA|~|0
70323|~|Arafat|~|While this is important to note, this kind of argument ignores the effects a co-sponsorship or lack thereof can have. Withdrawing from support, or not offering to support, can certainly lead to silencing if the organization in question is strong enough or is seen as a crucial component (in this case, for example, the organizers might have really wanted support from CJL, and therefore disinvited Prof Weiss). The question is what, legitimately, can the CJL be expected to support. We should remind readers that CJL gets a lot more support from Princeton than Hillels traditionally get from the universities which they serve, and that is in part because CJL has a mission to serve the entire Jewish population on campus.

70323|~|Gray|~|Israel knows full well how indoctrination can poison the well for peace. Just south of Israel’s border, in Gaza, the Hamas government has created an atmosphere of extremism that vilifies Israelis and Jews to the next generation. Gaza Kindergarten graduations feature “terrorist dress-up,” where five-year olds stage plays that glorify jihadists and suicide bombers. Families in Gaza watch public television sermons featuring Hamas ministers like ‘Atallah Abu Al-Subh, who recently claimed that (and I quote) “the Jews are the most despicable and contemptible nation to crawl upon the face of the Earth.” Incitement is no less prevalent under Abbas in the West Bank as it is under Hamas in Gaza. Under the PA, students learn history from textbooks that glorify terrorists – and learn geography from atlases that erase Israel from the map. Sports facilities, streets, and public buildings are named after terrorists, such as Dalal Mughrabi, a woman who led an attack on a bus that killed 38 Israeli civilians – including 13 children. Imagine if the Norwegian government named a playground after Anders Breivik – or if the US named a park after Charles Manson. What kind of message would it send to the children who play there?|~|9|~|Monday, October 13, 2014 8:48 AM|~|1633149206|~|1632708093|~|1

In a short amount of time _ short when compared too all other major religions - Islam has come to colonize and control vast areas thanks to its evil, expansionist, violent tenets.

70323|~|betterwould|~|The Irgun was not a terrorist group at all.  The Irgun never used violence against innocents for political purposes.  It mainly fought British authorities, but it did target Arab civilians from time to time for reprisals against the Arab community, which actively supported mass murder of Jews.  Irgun withdrew its policy of Havlagah (restraint) in 1936, after the Arab irregulars escalated their attacks on Jewish targets.  Irgun waited a total of seven years between the gruesome Hevron and Safed massacres in which dozens of Jewish men, women, and children were put to the sword and tortured to death.  Eventually, the Irgun replaced its policy of Havlagah with a policy of harsh reprisal in order to deter further attacks on Jewish civilians.  It is also important to note that the reprisal policy was largely abandoned after 1939.  |~|6|~|Tuesday, October 14, 2014 8:54 PM|~|1639570769|~|1633357432|~|1

70323|~|Talk about Hypocrisy...|~|Thank you betterwould, for the clarification. I would also like to clarify that I am not a Muslim, but a person of conscience with a critical spirit. I seek knowledge and diverse sources of information. I have had the opportunity to experience enough bigotry to understand how marginalized peoples are misinterpreted, stereotyped, and scapegoated by the media and political groups. I refuse to do unto other was has been done to me. The more I learn, the more aware I become, and I know that there are many people around the world who face greater injustices and adversities than me. I feel duty to voice and advocate for them in their absence. I was raised Christian and taught to treat others with respect and dignity, including muslims, atheist, jews, and palestinians too. I believe no one is "illegal" and I also believe we all deserve a home, sovereignty, self-sufficiency and human rights, regardless of ethnicity or religion. I do not believe in theocracies. Terrorism and religion are not the same, but rather politicized religion and radical ideology serve as a platform for colonialism as well as insurgency and guerrilla warfare. We Christians have historically justified slavery and amerindian-genocide by misusing scripture to serve our interests. It is also important to be critical of governments and foreign policy and recognize how occupation, colonialism, and state-terrorism fuel a cycle of poverty, instability, and consequently guerilla recruiting (terrorism). I condemn the men(IS) who are displacing and killing minorities, including Christians like me, and I also condemn invasions like the one in Iraq where hundreds of thousands of people were killed. I also condemn the War on Terror as it unjustly and indiscriminately kills people and only creates more terrorists. When it comes to people, including women and children, they all matter- not just Christian or Jews.  I don't believe a life is worth less than another. I will now excuse myself and spend my time proactively.|~|31|~|Sunday, October 12, 2014 10:23 PM|~|1637852837|~|1636764463|~|0

Maybe some were invited to participate in conferences as you mentioned, but I know of other examples, where people were not admitted, and at least in one case, told to leave an academic conference when their affiliation came to light. Even if this is not, then, a boycott against Israeli academics in general, their affiliation with boycotted institutions, in practice, closes doors.

With due respect, you have the typical historical Jewish minority, "PLEASE LIKE ME" complex and it is so pitiful to read. Throughout Jewish History especially in Nazi Germany there were those Jews who begged to be accepted and liked by the host country's people. "Like me and I will eat ham for you on Yom Kippur. Like me and I will put up a Christmas tree and call it a Hanukah Bush, like me and I will only pray one day a week, Sunday if you wish (the early German Reformed Jews), etc." The first Jews to be gassed by Hitler were those Reformers ("please like me...") who were viewed as a major threat by Hitler and his Jew hating Nazis. Fast forward to today: Here you are apologizing for Israel who is expected to live a double standard. Never mind the rockets and atrocities implemented by the Palestine people. If you read your history parts of Jordan are supposed to include part of Palestine--the world has convenient amnesia with this one. In the meantime here you are with your "please like me" attitude and no matter what you do they are NOT going to like you. You can stand on your head, eat ham and cheese sandwiches and they are still going to hate you because you are a Jew, period! Look in the mirror and accept that you are a Jew. Say it to yourself over and over and perhaps YOU can accept YOURSELF. Remember, if Israel disappears (the Jewish Host country) there IS NO place for American Jews or the World Jewish community to go in the event of another pogrom, anti-Semitic uprising or Holocaust. If there is another anti-Semitic uprising you are a Jew to these people no matter how much you apologize or try to appease them.|~|12|~|Monday, October 13, 2014 9:38 AM|~|1633871688|~|1633726741|~|0

There's been a lot of debate about how far this extends, and there will be into the foreseeable future. But hell, the University invited Castro over in the 1960s to give a speech. Even Princeton, the "conservative Ivy," has done some radical things. And that's because academic freedom allows for it. I'm not sure whether I agree with Prof. Weiss's opinions. I haven't read them too carefully. But I am sure that I don't want a non-University voice having any say whatsoever in who gets to speak here. It's a dangerous precedent. There's a very clear line between controversial opinions and hate speech. As long as speakers stay on the right side of that line, I welcome them to the University, even if I disagree with every fiber of my being. That's the issue at hand here. Your BS about the constitution is just a distraction. No one is pretending this is a constitutional issue. But just because it ain't constitutional doesn't mean it isn't important to this University. Since you're not a member of the University community, I don't expect you to understand the subtleties of the issue of academic freedom, or the discourse that already exists around it.

But, perhaps we should amend the above comparison, since at the anti-gay marriage events, at least the speaker doesn't boycott all universities in states that allow gay marriage. Weiss, on the other hand, boycotts Israeli academic institutions. If he thought he had a compelling argument, he'd promote collaboration with Israeli universities, especially since that's where the most nuanced, fair-minded opposition to the current Israeli government can be found.

Israelophobia is a block of hatred crystallized around a piece of land, around an idea. Anti-Zionism today, from Malmö to Qom, arises and multiplies entirely from prejudice against Israel: many of its most vicious critics have never even set foot in the state. These attacks on Israel are all too often made up of devastating classical anti-Semitic projections, lies and distortions to delegitimize Israel -- the blood libel that Jews kill non-Jewish children to use their blood to bake matzah; bottomless greed; indifference, and savage cruelty toward anyone who is not Jewish. Even legitimate geopolitical decisions -- such as the right to self-defense, or not being expected to hold territory in perpetuity until such time as one's sworn enemies might perhaps decide not to threaten annihilation, with no cost for the delay; or ignoring other countries accused of "occupation," such as Turkey in Cyprus, Pakistan in Kashmir or China in Tibet, while singling out only Israel for opprobrium.

Scholars working at such institutions have shown that matters of international conflict are rarely, if ever, as black and white as you present them, and that the best way to approach them is to understand the complicated factors that influence their development and might bring to their solution. Universities also have good reasons to believe – a few centuries' worth of experience on this – that the best way to reach such understandings is to let educated and learned opinion be heard regardless of whether we may agree with its conclusions and positions or not. Withdrawing one's support from an event in which an important scholar of the region is speaking is not the way of universities, and does not belong on a university campus. That is "choosing wisely" – not ignorant slogans.

What Chutzpah!   Jews are over represented on the Princeton campus, designed for and by Protestants and Deists (Scots/Irish).  Ms. Patton represent the diminished quality of education in our institutions of higher learning .  Jews cannot reach the level of superiority once appreciated in our institutions of higher learning, Princeton, Harvard, Yale, Columbia, etc.  Our country is in decline because our education is in decline. Americans are aware of the disgust and distrust of Jews in France and other countries generated by the “genocide” on Gaza and we Americans are just as disgusted and outraged  and I think that Slav Leibin is good candidate to start the exodus of Jews from America that is desirable by millions of patriotic Americans after watching the sadistic, demonic baby-killing Jew monsters, Netanyahu and the IDF terrorists  brutally murder 2000 Palestinian citizens among whom were 500 Palestinian children  and destruction of their homes, schools, hospitals with the blessing of members of congress who are paid agents for Israel.   Americans don’t want to be complicit in Israel’s pernicious, vile, evil abuse of the Palestinians and we don’t want our stolen tax dollars used to murder Palestinians  and we don’t want Jews who support such evil in our country.  Jews are the root and stem of every evil. During Operation Protective Edge, The IDF terrorists  murdered 2000 Palestinian citizens  among whom were 500 children.   Is the IDF any less a terrorist organization or any less evil than ISIS?  The IDF murdered 1400 Palestinians during Operation Cast Lead with the blessing of foreign agents for Israel serving in our congress. ISIS is more synonymous with the IDF terrorists than Hamas!  How was the beheading of  James Foley and Steven Sotloff any more horrific than the crushing to death of Rachel Corrie by a bulldozer driven by an IDF, terrorists?   How was the ‘war crime’ committed on the USS LIBERTY by Israeli terrorists any less horrific than the assault on the USS COLE by a Muslim  and the brutal murder of a Palestinian teenager who was burned alive any less horrific.  There are different standards for Jews and Muslims.  Jews  lie, steal and murder with impunity because they will be protected by members of congress, paid agents for Israel, who lack the intellect, sophistication and morals to serve in our Hallowed Halls of Congress for whom and by whom our Hallowed Halls of Congress were not designed.

Espousal of the boycott of Israel, especially its academic institutions, soon became the identifying mark of “progressive” English Jews, so much so that Howard Jacobson devoted a whole satirical novel (The Finkler Question, 2010) to “the Jews of shame,” people who were ashamed of Israel’s very existence, though not of their own illiteracy, cowardice, and treachery.|~|2|~|Monday, October 13, 2014 8:14 AM|~|1633154134|~|NA|~|1
70323|~|ToyotaBedZRock|~|And this one: I feel sorry for you when I read your so called moderation. With due respect, you have the typical historical Jewish minority, "PLEASE LIKE ME" complex and it is so pitiful to read. Throughout Jewish History especially in Nazi Germany there were those Jews who begged to be accepted and liked by the host country's people. "Like me and I will eat ham for you on Yom Kippur. Like me and I will put up a Christmas tree and call it a Hanukah Bush, like me and I will only pray one day a week, Sunday if you wish (the early German Reformed Jews), etc." The first Jews to be gassed by Hitler were those Reformers ("please like me...") who were viewed as a major threat by Hitler and his Jew hating Nazis. Fast forward to today: Here you are apologizing for Israel who is expected to live a double standard. Never mind the rockets and atrocities implemented by the Palestine people. If you read your history parts of Jordan are supposed to include part of Palestine--the world has convenient amnesia with this one. In the meantime here you are with your "please like me" attitude and no matter what you do they are NOT going to like you. You can stand on your head, eat ham and cheese sandwiches and they are still going to hate you because you are a Jew, period! Look in the mirror and accept that you are a Jew. Say it to yourself over and over and perhaps YOU can accept YOURSELF. Remember, if Israel disappears (the Jewish Host country) there IS NO place for American Jews or the World Jewish community to go in the event of another pogrom, anti-Semitic uprising or Holocaust. If there is another anti-Semitic uprising you are a Jew to these people no matter how much you apologize or try to appease them.|~|0|~|Tuesday, October 14, 2014 3:09 AM|~|1633156038|~|1633154134|~|1

If a Princeton professor is disinvited from a Princeton CJL event for ideological reasons, as seems to be the case here, then the University should review its support and be prepared to end it.

To be clear, Princeton is making concerted efforts to be more inclusive (see the hiring of Lew-Williams and he ongoing search for another professor). I'm glad the commenter PU brought up America's racial context. It's important to recognize that the Asian American struggle is not limited to modern day issues (bamboo ceiling, status as the poorest demographic in certain urban areas, under representation in government, objectification of Asian women, emasculation of Asian men, potentially racially motivated violence like the cases of Xinran Ji or Kang Wong), but that our experience is part of a greater historical context of racial violence and oppression (Rock Springs, Watsonville, internment camps, Vincent Chin, LA riots, etc.).|~|7|~|Wednesday, October 1, 2014 3:55 AM|~|1614318680|~|NA|~|1
69154|~|'16|~|Slavery is the original sin of America (that and the genocide of the indigenous Native Americans, but that was so thorough that outside of reservations Americans generally forget that there are any left). The legacy of slavery makes the racism toward black Americans different from the legacy of racism toward any other group. Don't get me wrong, we should definitely address issues of racism toward other groups. But the racism we see against, say, East Asian Americans and South Asian Americans looks far more like the turn-of-the-century racism against other immigrant groups, like Eastern Europeans and Southern Europeans. The racism against those groups was mostly rooted in anti-immigration prejudice. Given how many Princeton students are first or second generation immigrants (seriously, among my friends I'm one of the only people with four American-born grandparents) we should absolutely address these issues when talking about diversity. But we should also talk about why anti-black racism is so strong, even fifty years after the civil rights era ended. The racism against blacks is uniquely enduring in the United States. Seeing as you grew up in Korea and then an almost all white suburb, you may not be aware of it firsthand. This doesn't take away from any abuse done to you for your race, but it's something to consider.|~|4|~|Wednesday, October 1, 2014 10:41 AM|~|1614890649|~|NA|~|0

It was the most salient issue in the struggle for civil rights in America, and black-white relations still frame many debates today.

If Princeton did not have an absolutely top-notch graduate program, all those award-winning faculty members you like to boast to your friends about would never even have considered teaching here. There are very few academics who come to Princeton simply to teach a bunch of half-asleep undergrads, they come to do solid research work. A university's reputation lives and dies on its research, and grad students are the key to that. Every single science/tech article you've ever seen in the media that mentions Princeton is representative of years of hard work by grad students with their advisors. And just to be completely clear, grad students do a large proportion of the work for almost any research project.

Grad students give up significant financial gains to contribute to the sum of human knowledge, because that's what they're passionate about. 13% is really great given how little money we make as academics.

Again, I'm not going to argue who was right or wrong in the shooting because I've heard so many conflicting accounts. I don't know what happened, and neither do you. However, assuming Darren Wilson really shot a fleeing Michael Brown, which I am very willing to believe if an unbiased investigation concluded such, my point was simply to say please don't assume malicious intention. You can't imagine how difficult such a position is and mistakes are a real possibility. There is a lot more I wish I could have put in this article. Last April, John Winkler was accidentally shot by police officers while fleeing a stabbing in West Hollywood. He was aggressively running towards the deputies, as you would expect someone fleeing for his life would do. Directly in front of him was another victim bleeding profusely from the neck who appeared to be running from Winkler. In a matter of milliseconds, police had to make a snap judgement with dire consequences if judged wrong. In this instance, they indeed judged incorrectly and shot an innocent man. This is equally as tragic as the shooting of Michael Brown, but people are not up in arms simply because Winkler was white. The sad truth is that people make mistakes, and police officers are no different. But its unfair for you to make assumptions about the situation. That being said, police officers make astoundingly few mistakes given the difficulty and volatile nature of their job. If Wilson made a mistake, he should no longer be a police officer. If an investigation found malicious intention, then he should be prosecuted for murder. But just as criminals are innocent until proven guilty, so should be the people who dedicate their lives to protecting us.|~|6|~|Sunday, September 28, 2014 1:26 PM|~|1609600409|~|1609541631|~|1

We have no idea whether what they're saying is true, or whether they've considered other options (including the more conventional choice of student loans). Heck, one friend of mine here at Princeton took two years off to work low-wage unskilled jobs in order to have enough money to come back and pay his bills. There are many other jobs that the two student sex workers could have taken, but they chose sex work. I respect Weeks' and the unnamed Columbia student's choices, but it doesn't seem like they're under nearly as much duress as Mr. Hammer believes. College is expensive, and a very small minority of students choose to do sex work. But the two are hardly related. If we really want to talk about people who are *actually* forced into sex work, let's devote a column to human trafficking.|~|1|~|Wednesday, September 17, 2014 12:33 AM|~|1592622417|~|NA|~|0

67321|~|sciguybm|~|Technically, what is different from the norm IS bad. Homophobia is a catch-phrase for counter-naturals looking for media support...the correct phrase is "heterocentric' and you'd better memorize it, that will be the rally cry back to normalcy and away from deviancy....if there is one.   Check your local craigslist, under Personals, try reading the "men seeking men" and "women seeking women"....no, don't shy away embarrassed; READ THEM. Learn what is the reality. it is not a lifestyle; it is much much less. And it is not normal and not natural. I am sorry your children are affected/afflicted. It is as much your fault as the companies that did it to them. You wanted easy, cheap, convenient? You wanted easy retirement and stock portfolios? This was the price... endocrine disrupting chemicals that made your men women and your women men. That gave you breast, prostate, ovarian and uterine cancer. That made your children weak, sickly, angry, lost, out of control of their emotions and their minds. Visual stimulation, as the author condemns it, is normalcy. It says, as Doree says: "... the act of “catcalling” to be an innocuous form of “self-empowerment” for women, saying that it should deliver a “drive-by dose of confidence” rather than being considered something as negative..." because that is what is normal, that is natural and that is the driving force. Women who are offended, insulted, "victimized" by it have other issues at play. Issues that are both unnatural and, possibly, uncontrollable. They will, as nature intends, not evolve into the future. We look upon today as the paramount of human evolution; it is a mere moment in time. One day, one year in many billion. The nature of what life has designed will not be deflected by legislation in some country, by organizations, by special laws, by alternate lifestyles..... nature/life is the defining omniscient force. No endocrine disrupting chemicals, no GMOs, no Monsantos, no DuPonts, no NOW, no demoncrats, no republicans...nothing will change the true path of life.  And if the path cannot be restored? Nature has the solution for that too: Senescence. Today is a brief time when confusion and extremity ruled, when mothers & fathers forgot what made the world and instead voted for their deviant children without recognizing the dead-end in doing that. But nature will prevail. It always does. It always will. Life is the answer to the question "Why are we here?" Period.|~|0|~|Monday, September 15, 2014 1:10 AM|~|1589477000|~|NA|~|1
67309|~|innocent|~|Finally! An editorial board position for improving the fairness of the Honor Code. This practice I call "the self-incriminating ambush" is one of many past practices and behaviors that feed into the confirmation bias that is the modus operandi of the Honor Committee. These two HC investigators and the fruits of their ambush plus the HC head and perhaps one other person determine when certain accusations are worthy of a hearing. But since about 85% of hearings end in a guilty verdict, these few people effectively set up the judgement that the seven member hearing committee merely confirms. Only accusations that are guilty enough go to a hearing before seven supposedly unbiased HC members. Many support and defend the all-student Honor Committee's tactics and results without ever knowing what they are. At last year's USG meeting, all applicants for HC positions endorsed this notion that anyone questioned by an HC investigator should know at the outset whether they were a witness or an accused.  This is one of many practices that makes the process unfair. Another is that hearing members may see accusatory evidence in advance without the benefit of defending evidence or testimony. Another is that in the event of a re-hearing because of unfair and biased practices in the first hearing, the same HC same members preside...Testimony against the accused that is false has no consequence...and this is fair? There is no consequence when the Committee is wrong or acts in an unfair or biased manner; the Committee can do anything because they can hide. No long standing administrator witnesses the proceedings to ensure it is fair and unbiased.  Senior committee members can bully junior ones; Tower members can "convert" their underclass prospects and nobody will ever know; deliberations are not recorded or monitored. There is a long way to go before we have an Honor Code we can be proud of.|~|2|~|Monday, September 15, 2014 12:12 PM|~|1590023990|~|NA|~|1

Terran President Chris St. John writes a follow-up email to the club expressing his dismay that someone sent the email to the Prince. My question for you, Marcelo: What is the scandal here? Did Terrace do something illegal, or act like it had something to hide, until your blog post tried to link it with recreational drug use? What did Terrace do beyond forwarding an email about MAPS's research that made you feel that "overriding public interest" should get involved? If the scandal here is that a Terran alumnus wanted his club to support his nonprofit's research, I hardly see where "overriding public interest" would warrant some journalism on the issue. You can't have it both ways, Marcelo. You'll have to work harder than taking lines from Chris's emails to prove that your "irreverent" blog post somehow exposed an institutional secret that the public has a right to know about.|~|47|~|Thursday, August 21, 2014 1:03 PM|~|1553151006|~|NA|~|0

66651|~|Appalled Princetonian|~|Hey Marcelo, I'm confused.  Was the pieced supposed to be "biting" and "irreverent," or is it a piece dedicating to informing the public?  Because last time I checked it's pretty impossible to be both unless you're John Stewart or Stephen Colbert, and both of these pieces of trash you've published are so poorly written, researched, and presented that they would get you fired from The National Enquirer.  Do you really think that the fact that you published one scrap of "Information...taken directly from public records filed with the IRS" means that your article is a fair and legitimate portrayal of MAPS or Terrace?  Try writing a paper for a class here or writing an article for any publication in the world (maybe one which you don't edit so that it actually acquires approval to publish, because I'm sure that any Editor with any sense would have killed the first story before publication) with that kind of citation and let me know if anyone takes you seriously. This response uses your position as Editor for a personal power trip, defending the (still) nameless author of the first piece.  And yet you still can't even muster up the smallest scrap of courage and maturity to openly admit your role in writing the first article.  Instead, you've chosen the cowardly option, indirectly admitting your authorship through your defense. Because, surely, no one else who writes for The Prince is nearly as bereft of journalistic integrity as you clearly are.  I hope people both higher and lower than you in your organization are informing you that with each ridiculous word you write you drag your name and that of The Prince more thoroughly through the mud.  And the fact that an Editor-in-Chief would damage his organization's name and credibility for a personal vendetta is shameful.  I hope that you will soon issue an apology, or perhaps even resign, as you are clearly unfit to be in charge of writing an acceptable article, let alone managing a whole paper. Finally, it appalls me that you have the gall to yet again publish private communications without the accompanying privacy disclaimer and twist them to fit your needs. You're not a writer for the Guardian publishing a Snowden leak to inform the world of America's misdeeds, you're a hack who thinks leaking private emails and cherrypicking quotes to paint a distorted and inaccurate picture is news. Get over yourself, do the Prince a favor by apologizing and/or resigning, and do us all a favor by removing this whole mess from the internet.

66651|~|Good work|~|At times I can be highly critical of the Princetonian, but you guys did a great job with this piece. Forget the haters. They either a) missed the entire point of the blog post, or b) believe that "the mother" and Princeton in general shouldn't be subject to the same kind of scrutiny that (most of) the rest of the world faces. If it's the former, then it might be worth further clarifying the original argument; after reading the blog post, I could see how one could conflate the original argument with one against MAPS. Yet for the latter, you'll have trouble convincing them at all. They not only believe that "Terrans" and Princetonians are entitled to the use of recreational drugs without punishment, but also deserve the right to abuse drugs without any kind of scrutiny, an entitlement that folks in the real world don't share (just ask any of the hundreds of black prisoners serving 25 to life for marijuana possession). You're trying to reveal this culture of drug use to those who are ignorant of it, not those who actively accept it and try to defend it. Don't even get me started on those who bitch about the disclaimer. I doubt many of them were very vocal about the NSA disclaimers on the Snowden documents, or the classified classification of the Pentagon Papers.

66651|~|'16|~|Nice talking point with "black prisoners serving 25 to life for marijuana possession." Quite sincerely, you highlight a great injustice. However, you somehow use this to attack drug use among Princetonians. So your argument is... Princetonians should be locked up for 25 years to life as well? Yes, it's unjust how minorities are targeted in this way, but the solution isn't to make sure the entire population faces inhumane convictions. The only real solution is decriminalization, and if you truly cared about the black lives you mentioned, you'd advocate for that. And not advocate for "revealing a culture of drug use." You sound more like a drug czar. And of course, your comparison of Terrace's emails to the NSA documents just shows all of us how little sense of perspective you have.  --- It suddenly occurs to me, Marcelo, that ALL the eating clubs possess "a culture of drug use," to quote this commenter. They illegally serve alcohol to minors. Now THAT sounds like the scandal you're looking for. But seriously, you call your paper independent, but pointing out illegal drug usage instead makes you a pawn of the federal government. (And an instrument in upholding rhetoric which is used to imprison countless thousands of people, especially minorities.) A newspaper that thinks critically questions official rhetoric and the justness of laws.

66109|~|Glen Broemer|~|The Washington Post ran an article a while back re an ongoing argument between NYPD and the FBI... There isn't any shortage of sting opportunities, given the unending string of lawbreaking in the intelligence community, including their vast corrupt network in Los Angeles and Ventura, stretching into many businesses here, and obviously involving some government employees. I defended a Tax Suit a while back by noting that the entertainment industry had stolen dozens of phrases and ideas from my copyrighted work--many poem titles and lines, and other creative expressions converted directly to film titles. The list of intellectual property violations numbers in the hundreds or thousands, including naming the following from my poems, without my consent or prior knowledge: Vantage Point (2007), Idiocracy (2006), The Aura (Spanish: El Aura) (2005), Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus, Sky High (2005 film), The Perfect Score (2004); The Score, Wake of Death (2004), Torque (2004), You Wish! (2003), (2003), Big Fish ( 2003), The Ring (2002 ), I Am Sam (2001), The Sixth Sense(1999), Beowulf (2007), Gryphon (2007), Stomp the Yard (2007), Made of Honor (2008) Felon (2008), Box Elder (2008) and Fata Morgana (2007) Avatar (2008/2009) Daybreak (2008) Vantage Point (2008). All these words and titles come from Plaintiff’s copyrighted work Tribute Anthology (2007), unmarketed, meaning the information was actually taken directly from my computer or discs. I've filed several federal suits, one of which was in litigation for a decade before the community--through extensive battery and fraud--made false accusations and created new issues to prevent a just public condemnation of the community for eviscerating my rights over the course of decades. The worst liars, and the worst of these criminals--they are actually violating criminal codes daily--are on the right. A good thing to note when you're dealing with the manipulative self-impressed chess player sociopaths in the right wing intelligentsia, never accept the explanation they give you, always go back a step or two in time, and dig a little deeper. They're invariably lying. The FBI would be quite content to use a citizen as bait in FBI stings over the course of a lifetime. There isn't any shortage of sting opportunities, given the unending string of lawbreaking in the intelligence community, including their vast corrupt network in Los Angeles and Ventura, stretching into many businesses here, and obviously involving some government employees.These parties are all violating RICO , careful lies they believe are legally protected, with an obvious motive to attack an informant.

The intelligence community has framed me and given fraudulent psych profiles to the judiciary over the course of decades 2) the entertainment industry knew it, and quietly reaped the benefits of my creativity, fraudulently sold by the government (something like restitution or illegally seized property), and in fact colluded with the federal government, RICO 3) government and industry have killed my pets and physically attacked me for a decade in an effort to slow my investigation, and to intimidate, RICO II violation 4) government inspectors and FBI--those who were not complicitous, anyway-- have ruthlessly used me in stings against the community and industry, in many cases ensuring i would be harmed by putting me in harm's way against known, repeat offenders--often, I believe, as their own retaliation against me, RICO III 5) all of the above have curtailed my other options and interfered with my relationships in an effort to further their own schemes 6) i've lost a vast amount of intellectual property. my closest relationships, including a few engagements, were destroyed by the manipulations of the above individuals. i haven't been truly free a day in my entire adult life, either manipulation of my options or direct interference with my cognition, usually both..7) some in the judiciary knew, and some should have known, that the allegations against me were contrived and fraudulent, and some have participated in harming me 8) while there is little political support for prosecuting criminal actions that involve half of government, two presidents, Obama and to an extent Clinton, tried to do what is right, right a very corrupt situation. you don't need to be a genius to figure the politics involved, the problems they've faced so doing.9) you probably won't get a denial of any of this if you ask US Senators, and can in fact find letters of support from them as exhibits in my case filings. 10) yet the press has not covered this because? 11) the right has been physically attacking me or harming my pets in connection with every public criticism i've made.

I don't know if "suppressed" is quite right, but certainly, between a minority and non-minority figure, the non-minority often gets more airtime.  That's why it's often useful for people to take a step back and listen to what minorities have to say before rushing in to argue with or speak for them.  Yes, there's an extreme that we don't want to get to (never letting non-minorities speak), and on some occasions, some groups tip too close to that side.  That doesn't mean that the value of being aware of privilege, and when that privilege means you should spend some time listening rather than scramble to air your views, isn't still really valuable.|~|5|~|Monday, May 12, 2014 6:51 AM|~|1380780614|~|1380774954|~|1

65296|~|SSarra '16|~|Perhaps we travel in different circles and read different comments sections, but I have yet to see one person 'ridicule' or use 'ad hominem attacks' to respond to Fortgang's article. Indeed, I would say that overall the response from student commentators, and others outside the Princeton community, has been relatively tame in comparison to the smug attitude in Fortgang's original piece. I agree with much of what you say here, but the argument you make does not align with what you are trying to defend. Fortgang's thesis is essentially that he is immune from criticism because, as he states, he carries a privilege that is immune from any criticism. "It’s been made clear to me that education begins in the home, and the importance of parents’ involvement with their kids’ education—from mathematics to morality—cannot be overstated. It’s not a matter of white or black, male or female or any other division which we seek, but a matter of the values we pass along, the legacy we leave, that perpetuates “privilege.” And there’s nothing wrong with that." What Fortgang is saying here is disturbing- he is denying the history of this country.  From the first English, Dutch, and French settlements in North America until roughly the late 1960's/early 1970's it has been national policy to exact horrific state violence- physical, psychological, and economic- against peoples deemed unworthy of the mantle of American citizenship (a title 'bestowed' upon one by their perceived 'race'). Tal ignores all of this- ignores all of the benefits that his grandparents received upon their arrival to this country, ignores the benefits his parents received from their perceived race, and ignores the benefits he has in his life (not being stopped and frisked, not being followed in stores, not being targeted by drug police, having access to credit cards and home loans, I could go on and on), and states that "[i]t was [his grandparents'] privilege to come to a country that grants equal protection under the law to its citizens, that cares not about religion or race, but the content of your character." No. Not true. If his grandparents were black or brown (or east Asian), they most likely would not have had the same chance of being granted entrance to the United States as immigrants; they would not have had the same access to bank credit to start their small business; they would not have been free to choose whatever neighborhood they wanted to live in once they arrived; they did not run the risk of roving gangs of angry whites, or the state in which they lived, stealing their land and material assets because they didn't 'know their place.' Further, his father would not have had the access to college or career opportunities if the Fortgang family had been perceived as non-white. This line is further disturbing because it not only ignores the basic facts of American social and political history, but also because it implies that those who do not share the same station as him presently- economically or his place as a student at Princeton- do not do so simply because their parents and grandparents were bad their job; too lazy or incompetent to be "[involved] with their kids' education." It's the polite, Princeton way of saying that brown parents are lazy and bad parents who bring about their own poverty and socially ostracized status. This is mind-blowing ignorance at best, and veiled racism at worst, and calling it out for what it is is not "[declaring] illegitimate by virtue of the speaker’s privilege." It's declaring it illegitimate because it ignores the humanity of the people at the other end of that line of thought, and thus helps to perpetuate white supremacy. Fortgang's grandfather's experience is truly inspiring. There is no denying that (as the descendant of several survivors of the Great Depression and veterans of WWII, I understand the attachment to the lives and legacies of our ancestors). But Tal is not his grandfather. He is a white male, probably of middle class economic means or better, within a white supremacist society currently experiencing vast income and wealth inequality. While I do not know him or what personal experiences he may have had, on paper, his life looks like it is pretty damn peachy, especially in comparison to many of his non-white classmates and classmates of all colors and ethnicities of lesser economic means. Princeton, or any university that declares itself a defender of free speech and open intellectual discourse, must allow for all views to be aired freely without fear or reprisal; I agree with you wholeheartedly on that, author. But no has come out and told Fortgang to shut up. No one. Further, no one has called Fortgang a bigot (although I find myself more and more wanting to volunteer myself to be the first to do so). People are responding patiently and in well thought out, written responses in the Prince and in wider media. I am willing to have a debate on how the phrase 'check your privilege' is used, and the extent to which people should feel comfortable expressing their views in public spaces, class, and precept. It is good to see that you, "like everyone else, have a multitude of personas and identities... I am checking my privilege, but I am not my privilege." But here's the problem. Fortgang *is* claiming he is his privilege.  There are instances in which people are cowed from expressing their views because they are white, or cisgender, or neurotypical. This case, however, is not one of them. I was hoping not to turn my comment on your article into another critique of Fortgang's work, but it proves such a rich body of problematic and intellectually-empty fodder for angry ranting and comment post writing that I couldn't resist. My apologies Dodam Ih ’15, but do take care to actually read what you are defending and aligning your defense with what is actually there before you (I hope) inadvertently defend Fortgang's whitewashing (no pun intended) of American history and present reality.|~|22|~|Sunday, May 11, 2014 9:49 PM|~|1380457042|~|NA|~|1
65296|~|Eleanor Abernathy|~|This is a very thoughtful comment and, just as you agree with much of what Dodham Ih wrote, I agree with most of what you wrote.  I think, however, that you're missing the point, and that you're wrong to say that this piece is an attempt to defend Tal Fortgang. Perhaps it was a mistake for Ih to mention Fortgang at all, because this piece is not about him.  The thesis, as far as I can tell, is, "The phrase discourages discussions, leads to ad hominem attacks and dismisses arguments based on who the speaker is rather than what the speaker is saying," and I think the author does an excellent job of arguing that. At no point is Fortgang defended; the author is just saying that some of the critiques of his piece (apparently we do run in different circles, because I've definitely heard and even made some ad hominem attacks on Fortgang) aren't constructive to the debate.|~|20|~|Sunday, May 11, 2014 11:21 PM|~|1380523558|~|1380457042|~|0

The more we are unfairly attacked, marginalized, and blamed for every minority's failure to achieve parity with whites, the more numb we become to such gimmicks. Eventually we will reach the point where we no longer care what the left thinks of us. One day we will no longer seek the approval of our enemies. When that day comes, it will be the end of the left.

65296|~|Guest|~|What does slavery, which ended in 1865, in the USA, have to do with it? The Jews survived a holocaust, which ended only 69 years ago and wiped out two-thirds of their number; and yet, one does not see Jews turning once thriving cities and neighborhoods into ghettos. One does not see flash mobs of Jews attacking random Gentiles for fun. My point: how is it that Jews, who have had it much worse, in the past century at least, than American blacks, are faring so much better than American blacks. This is even more mystifying when one considers the considerable time, effort, and WHITE taxpayer money the USA government spent on trying to advance the status of blacks, while spending virtually nothing, by comparison, to help Jews. To me, at least, I think this disparity is entirely due to disparities in both intelligence and culture between blacks and Jews. This is my belief based on the evidence I have observed. |~|3|~|Tuesday, May 13, 2014 8:05 AM|~|1494743187|~|1494343540|~|0

White males are practically responsible for all the progress and civilization in the last thousand years, from finding the new continent to moon landing to internet... But they are also the ones responsible for exterminations, slaveries and holocaust.

If there is one thing that has helped the USA all these years is the fact that it's majority population has also been its more affluent.  Besides the fact that there isn't a direct correlation between demographics and share of power, the last thing you want is to live in a place where majority is non white and poorer. The last thing you want is a place where a minority (usually white) has the concentration of all political and economic power....societies like those live in constant fears of revolt. I know that for my own experience, as I am born and raised in Latin America; with the exception of Argentina and Uruguay every other country is minority white, and in all of them, no exception, white Hispanics, descendants of Europeans have the most social, political, economic power and status.

Fortgang and Dodam about people assuming just because he's some race/gender/whatever that he hasn't had to work hard for his achievements (and generally shutting down conversations because of that), and others in the broader "there are ways in which being certain a certain race/gender/etc. are beneficial today and we should be aware of them".  Thankfully I've never encountered anyone using "privilege" in the sense Dodam and Fortgang are talking about.  At least not here. Because that would be stupid.  If someone said "check your privilege" to him and he took that to mean that his achievements are not his own or anything like that then either (1). He misunderstood  them. (2) The person who said that is an idiot. Unfortunately I don't think he or most of "his supporters" have addressed in the second sense of privilege in any serious way.  Which is of course the more important and defendable one (not to mention empirically supported).

The (alleged) "beneficial" utility of artificial class distinctions has nothing (zero. nada. zilch.) to do with individual rights.

65178|~|Brian Wilcox '13|~|Thank you, Kevin, for writing this. Men are also important, if not the most important, agents in many cases of assault. But I would like to clarify one thing: the university does not, and never has, instituted "harsh punishments" for perpetrators of assault. At the time of my assault, people were commonly given 1-year suspensions for writing past "time" on in-class finals (violation of the Honor Code) while the few people actually reported for assault were given no, or merely symbolic (as in the case of the "warning") consequences. In my own assault, the Rocky College Disciplinary Board decided on a verdict of "No Finding", which translates to: Meh, we don't want to say yes or no, so let's go with "maybe" and give the accused a "warning". My attacker saw no consequences for the crime he committed. To this day, the possible consequences for an Honor Code Violation are clearly stated in Rights, Rules, and Responsibilities (Section 2.3.3, "Guilty Verdict and Consequences") while NO possible consequences are even mentioned in cases involving "sexual misconduct" (Section 1.2.3). So, while campus culture and male students are definitely huge, important parts of the solution and bring much to the table in terms of future constructive action, University administrators and University policy still need to be included, involved, and (in the case of policy) interrogated for how it can improve to realistically protect the campus community from violence, and violent people, such as this.|~|6|~|Friday, May 9, 2014 2:32 PM|~|1377109212|~|NA|~|0
65178|~|Consequences|~|Did you go to the police? Get a rape kit done? etc. "No Finding" can also mean: there's no evidence beyond two alternate versions of events that differ only in the exact things that determine whether a wrong was committed. Without clear evidence of a crime, punishment IS NOT WARRANTED. This very paper published a story attacking Honor Committee/Disp Board proceedings as lacking in various due process protections, including mixing prosecutor/judge roles and ignoring exculpatory evidence. They were quite right to do so.|~|1|~|Sunday, May 11, 2014 4:40 AM|~|1379057996|~|1377109212|~|0
65178|~|saymyname|~|Thanks, Kevin!  It's really great to get men talking about these issues.  One point of concern:  I'd rather not have "sad, hurt, and violated" as a part of the same calculation.  One of these things is not like the other.  While I am all for thinking about women's feelings, I'm uncomfortable with the implication that accusations of sexual assault are the result of women being "sad" or "hurt."  This isn't about a guy who doesn't call the next day; it's about a guy who pursues a woman because she's vulnerable.  That's violation, not hurt feelings.  I'm fairly sure you understand this difference, but--as some of the comments show--if you give some people a rhetorical inch, they'll take a mile.|~|4|~|Friday, May 9, 2014 2:36 PM|~|1377115181|~|NA|~|0
65178|~|The Dilettante|~|I think this is a very sweet and earnestly well-intentioned article, which is no surprise and in keeping with my understanding of the author's personality.  Unfortunately I think it's not a little naive, not only because of its demonstrably false characterization of the University's response to the rape crisis (what "harsh punishments?) and its understatement of the consequences of rape on women (being raped is about more than "deep hurt"), but also because of its central premise.  It's terribly unlikely that organizations like the frats and the eating clubs will ever "man up" and address sexual assault head-on because they rely for their very founding principles upon a masculinist and patriarchal (as well as class-elitist and probably racist, but that's a whole other discussion) view of the world.  The best thing to do would be to get rid of them altogether, but that won't likely happen. It'd be nice if the clubs could prove me wrong and take this problem seriously head-on.  But alas, like Cassandra, I am too often doomed to be right.|~|2|~|Tuesday, May 13, 2014 6:09 PM|~|1383632589|~|NA|~|1
65178|~|mostberg|~|According to the Daily Beast Princeton has the 2nd worst rate of forceable rape of all the 450 plus colleges and universities noted.   53 forceable rapes in a 3 year period.   Other schools had more, but the Princeton rate of infamy was the second highest rate.  This is a scandel of major proportions and likely was caused by only mild rebuke and suspensions whereas the "men" should be in prison for this.   We need to make Princeton pay the price.   If they will not protect the young women and have offenders jailed, parents and the young women should take pleasure in suing the university into bankruptsy.  As it stands now young women at Princeton would be safer at home or in a job - even the military.   I would not encourage my very bright granddaughter to apply there.  Princeton has become a  backwater school that protects its worst and lets the women bare the consequences.

There is no connection between pride in one's academic accomplishments and a lack of understanding of the poor or marginalized.

65121|~|Michael D.|~|Dear "Oh Please" --   Pray, could you please explain why "jealousy" is involved in this debate?  When I was a student at dear old Nassau, and basically as clueless as you certainly sound in your post, I met people who thought that most students had not the least idea of what 95% of the country has to do every day to get the rent/mortgage/groceries paid.  Those who were from genuinely poor neighborhoods opined that: 1. they found the blatant consumerism and lack of compassion or respect for janitors and university workers around them of many students loathsome and ; 2.  that there were some well-off white students whose education, interests and even native intelligence were shockingly...mediocre.  Not surprisingly, many of these students were male athletes. Others were multi-generation legacies, with alumni parents.   My frosh/sophmore year roommate was a legacy student (five generations of eldest males were graduates), but he graduated Phi Beta Kappa and exactly the kind of student we think Princeont should have.  The problem was that some of these less-privileged folks thought everyone admitted would be of his caliber.   Many were not.     A great many of the people I recall saying such things transferred to other institutions.  They were (and are) about as jealous of you as they are of Donald Trump or Donald Sterling--in which group please include me, as I would rather be a janitor at Princeton than become such a disgusting, disgraceful excuse for a man, much less a human being, as either of those two buffons--one modestly rich (having managed not to lose all the money his father left him), the other a genuine self-made Croesus.  You see, some people actually judge other people by their character, compassion and conscience.

65002|~|the logician|~|Let's be clear on what the debate about so called "rape culture" is about. It is not about how we treat victims of rape. We all agree 100% that any victim of rape, including the author of the article, is entitled to a fair hearing and a fair chance to present the evidence of her case. It is also not about the moral significance of rape. We all agree 100% that any sexual act that is initiated by a party A to a party B without the consent of party B is always wrong and merits punishment. There are two points on which people seem to have divergent opinions: (1) The ability of a drunk person to consent (2) The prevalence of rape ==== Concerning (1), we now show that drunk people have the ability to consent. Proposition: An adult who freely inebriates himself is able to consent to sexual intercourse even in his state of inebriation. (a) Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that an adult who freely inebriates himself is not able to consent to sexual intercourse in a state of inebriation. (Assumption) (b) A party P1 who has intercourse with a party P2 in which party P2 has not given consent has raped P2. (Definition of rape). (c) Whenever a husband has intercourse with his drunk wife he does not have her consent. (Follows from a) (d) Whenever a husband has intercourse with his drunk wife he rapes her. (Follows from b and c). (e) It is not the case that whenever a husband has intercourse with his drunk wife that he rapes her. (Self evident) Conclusion: By reductio ad absurdum, it follows from (d) and (e) that (a) is false. Thereby we derive ~(a) which is the proposition. Another way to get to the same conclusion is by thinking about responsibility. (a) A person who inebriates himself voluntarily and commits a crime, such as murder, is responsible for his actions. (Given, part of our legislation) (b) Whenever a person is responsible for his actions, he is expected to make rational decisions about his actions. (Definition of responsibility). (c) If a person is expected to make rational decisions about his actions, he can make them, that is to say from a policy standpoint, he is considered able to make those rational decisions. (Definition of expectation) (d) A person who inebriates himself voluntarily can make rational decisions about others. (Follows from a, b, and c). (e) If a person can make rational decisions about others he can make them about himself. (Follows from substituting any properties found in an external agent with oneself, also self evident) (f) A person who inebriates himself voluntarily can make rational decisions about himself. (Follows from d, e) (g) Consent to sexual intercourse is a rational decision about oneself. (Definition of consent) Conclusion: The proposition follows from (f) and (g). Also as pointed out in the comments by Concerned '81, the legal system of every state in the union recognizes the ability of freely inebriated individuals to consent. The reasoning here is just to show why. ===== Concerning (2). The other important point in the debate in the comment section is the prevalence of rape and how it should shape our public policy. If rape is as prevalent as some comments suggest -- citing that 1 in 4 or 1 in 5 women will be raped -- then a "rape culture" certainly does exist and we need to allocate proper resources to combat it. However, if rape is as rare as some comments suggests -- as little as less than .1% of women being raped -- then it is disingenuous to claim there is a "rape culture" or a norm of "rape" being acceptable given that it almost never ever takes place. Furthermore, if stats reflect that false rape accusations are much more prevalent than rape, then it is logical to be skeptical of rape claims insofar as skepticism is limited to requiring a burden of proof commensurate to the claim -- as is the case when we adjudicate all cases of civilian misconduct -- and not treating the accusers themselves with scorn or contempt, but ensuring a fair hearing. Proposition: Rape is a very rare occurrence, and thus there is no "rape culture". At the same time, a significant percentage of rape accusations are false. (a) When estimating the prevalence of a phenomenon, a representative sample is preferable to a non-representative sample, all else being equal. (Principles of statistical methods) (b) The FBI data on rape using a large, nationally representative sample, and derives that 53 per 100,000 females are raped annually which is .053%. ( http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cj ... (c) The CDC data claiming "1 in 5" women were raped does not use a representative sample but instead one with a small sample and a small response rate of 27.5% that compounds the bias (National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey 2010:  http://www.cdc.gov/violencepre ..., video on it's flaws for those who don't have time to read it:       Play       Hide          (d) The CDC data has more women being raped than men (1 in 5 vs 1 in 71), but we know that in the prison population alone, more men are raped than women. (National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey 2010, Sexual Victimization in Prisons and Jails Reported by Inmates, 2011–12: National Inmate Survey, 2011–12). (e) The CDC data contradicts information from a variety of established sources that use large representative samples and have decades of consistent reporting data (Follows from (c) and (d)). (f) The CDC data cannot be trusted. (Follows from (e)). (g) The rate of false rape accusations is about 41% with statistics gathered from a variety of sources including the FBI ("False Rape Allegations" by Eugene Kanin, Archives of Sexual Behavior Feb 1994 v23 n1 p81 (12), The Politics of Sexuality, Barry M. Dank, Editor in Chief, Vol. 3 at 36, n. 8. , McDowell, Charles P., Ph.D. “False Allegations.” Forensic Science Digest, (publication of the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations), Vol. 11, No. 4 ) Conclusion: The proposition follows from ( (b), (f), and (g) ). ====== Summary: Think carefully. There are matters of fact about the world we live in, and when you have a set of statistics that greatly disagree you have to come to terms with the fact that they cannot both be correct. One has to be right and the other has to be wrong if they disagree about the truth of some proposition at the same time and in the same sense. When you look at all the data on the subject it is incredibly clear that rape is a rare phenomenon and that there must be clear and convincing evidence of rape before anyone accused should be subject to punishment. At the same time, we must be careful to give full support and comfort to any victims of sexual violence. While there is no "rape culture" there is certainly a need to ensure that any victims of rape have the chance to be heard and dealt with fairly. I conclude by saying that justice doesn't come from fabricating statistics, or excusing female irresponsibility, or shaming men as a whole. It comes from seeking out the truth and reasoning about what's best for our society.|~|4|~|Friday, May 9, 2014 3:37 AM|~|1376287906|~|NA|~|1

65002|~|'16|~|Interesting point, but the fact that the bulk of your argument lies in your final 1.5 paragraphs shows how thin the evidence is here. I have a hard time believing, for example, that things would have turned out differently for the author of  “Dear Harvard, You Win" if Harvard's policies used the word "rape" more often in defining and referring to certain classes of sexual assault. It seems the biggest argument Harvard's administration used to avoid punishing the aggressor was that he hadn't been found guilty of a punishable act by any formal investigation. Perhaps Sokolow was wrong in that calling rape "non-consensual sex" would meaningfully reduce this barrier, but I think he was on to something in identifying this barrier as an important problem. The fact that the problem hasn't been eliminated by the increasing use of the term "non-consensual sex" doesn't mean that the term is at fault. And I also can't imagine a rapist trying to minimize their actions by saying, "It wasn't rape; it was just non-consensual sex."|~|2|~|Tuesday, May 6, 2014 9:55 PM|~|1372950606|~|NA|~|0
65002|~|'18|~|It's true, that a rapist probably wouldn't justify his actions by saying, "It was just non-consensual sex." But he could say, "She didn't say no. Not really. It's not like I bashed her or anything. It wasn't rape." And that would be admitting to not-so-perfectly-consensual sex.|~|0|~|Wednesday, May 7, 2014 9:52 PM|~|1374459169|~|1372950606|~|0
65002|~|'14|~|The word "rape" carries a lot of etymological and cultural baggage associated with violence. Seizure by force, not sexual violation, was the center of the definition of the Latin raptio as well as early modern English usages of "rape" (See also: The Rape of the Lock). Hence, while the modern meaning of rape exclusively refers to the non-consensual sex, its cultural connotations of application of violent force (1) causes people to wince and (2) makes it difficult for people to identify nonviolent incidents, such as ones involving incapacitation, or nonviolent "pressured sex," as rape.|~|1|~|Thursday, May 8, 2014 1:03 AM|~|1374620877|~|NA|~|0

65002|~|'15|~|I hear you--the word "rape" is a word in our society that evokes the correct reactions to sexual assaults. One reason, however, why the University probably uses language like "sexual assault" over the term "rape" is not to desensitize or undermine an experience, but rather to encompass more experiences of victims and survivors. In several states, "rape" legally means the penetration of the vagina by a penis. This definition sucks, because it rejects the experiences of so many in our communities like for example, but most certainly not limited to, men who may be assaulted by other men, or women who assault men, or women who assault other women. So while "rape" may garner a reaction, I think it's equally important that the language we use encompass the variety of experiences of people in our communities.|~|0|~|Thursday, May 8, 2014 11:50 PM|~|1376134461|~|NA|~|0

65002|~|Alcohol and Consent|~|This is where I believe a lot of the confusion enters the conversation. Everyone believes violent forcible rapists are deserving of the harshest possible punishment. But when the alcohol consumption vs. consent issue becomes involved there's a great deal of debate, often because it is difficult for either party to know how intoxicated the other party is. Certainly the scenario you propose is rape, plain and simple. But there are grey areas that make people uncomfortable, because of the possibilities for misunderstandings that lead to highly severe consequences. It's a tough question. But the alcohol consumption vs. consent issue seems to be at the crux of the disagreements here. The University sets much stricter standards for the level of alcohol that must be consumed to vitiate consent than the state does. Is this a good or a bad thing? I don't know. I know rape is a huge societal issue I know sexual assault is a massive problem. And I know the alcohol-fueled culture of sex on any college campus makes for complex scenarios that rarely fit the "sex on a Saturday night" stereotype.|~|0|~|Thursday, May 8, 2014 11:39 AM|~|1375199214|~|NA|~|0

64968|~|'04|~|The more I listen to these stories the more I think that victims might benefit from good legal representation.  I was sexually harassed pretty badly just out of grad school, and a big reason my abuser mostly got away with it was her more sophisticated understanding of the system and my shock.  Hiring a lawyer would have also given me more credibility both as a victim and as a threat, which is exactly what I was--a threat to illegitimate power.  Fortunately, I also had some exposure to lawyers after graduation, so I was very meticulous about documenting the harassment, which proved to be very useful.  As an undergrad, there's no way I would have known that and even if I had been John Roberts, I think representing myself in the wake of trauma would have been extremely difficult.  A lawyer can help you navigate your options in the criminal justice and civil systems and against your attacker or the school. So, advice from an alum: hire a lawyer. If you can't afford one try to get legal aid or pro bono help.  Women's groups should reach out to alums to establish a legal defense fund if necessary.|~|14|~|Tuesday, May 6, 2014 9:45 PM|~|1372940896|~|NA|~|0

64968|~|'04|~|Those are really good questions.  In my sexual harassment case, I was initially reluctant to hire a lawyer for several reasons.  First, and maybe most important, my work with my harasser before she crossed the line was very intense and involved a lot of confidential information.  So when she violated my trust, it was shocking: everything took on a confusing double meaning, and all options jeopardized my work--a true double bind.  Second, I was either in denial or naive about her character, and I thought I could work things out between us.  Third, I didn't know what to expect from a lawyer, and the last thing I wanted at the time was a big, new experience that involved telling personal material to strangers.  And forth, I didn't realize the way in which I had been dragged into what was not only a professional and psychological dilemma but also a legal one. What I wish I had realized then was that: my harasser had crossed a line of decency and common sense severe enough to be a crime against the community.  That is, she had violated a public trust that couldn't be restored by anything she said or did to me.   Not that she ever made amends even when given multiple chances.  Some people you just can't work with.  Furthermore, shielding her from the consequences of her behavior did no one a favor--not me, not others in the organization, and not even her.  Sometimes, the best thing you can do for someone is to tell hard truths and/or punish their behavior.  Tough love from a safe distance.  Secondly, that all this drama could be translated into the concrete language of the legal system where I could offload a good deal of shame and perceived responsibility that felt imposed upon me.  Also, that had I chosen to file a civil suit, my lawyer would have received a portion of the damages, and I wouldn't have had to pay him or her.  Also, that I would have had an empowering degree of control over my legal options and wouldn't have had to be maximally punitive. Of course, every case is individual; I was lucky enough to be able to change jobs; rape is more severe than harassment, and harassment invokes labor law.  But the principles of injury through negligence and wrongdoing seem pretty similar to me.  I mean if a contractor threw a brick off the Frist Center at you, broke your shoulder, and refused to pick up your medical bills most adults wouldn't hesitant to consult a lawyer.  Why should a more intense crime like rape be any different?  No one is born knowing how to be a champion victim, but a good lawyer can help you there... legally, at least.  Likewise, for good therapists, religious or philosophical leaders, friends, etc. in other ways.  Of course, no one is morally responsible for crimes committed against them.  This comment is simply addressed to victims because I believe they might listen to someone who has been in a less intense but similar situation. P.S.  The best thing I did with my harasser was to warn her off when things got weird then send her an email summarizing our conversation, "I don't want to be presumptuous, but when you did X, I was uncomfortable.  Please, never do X again.  I look forward to a excellent professional relationship with you going forward."  (If necessary you can add, "if X or other sexually suggestive comments persist, I will consider A, B, or C.")  Later when she ignored it, I then had written proof that her conduct was explicitly "unwelcome" in legal terms.  Of course, this technique only works in a pre-existing relationship going off the tracks.|~|3|~|Wednesday, May 7, 2014 5:29 PM|~|1374161762|~|1373973710|~|0

64968|~|Hippie Mom|~|When I went to parents weekend the fall of my daughter's freshman year, I stood up at the health session and asked, as a person who had been raped her freshman year at college, if my daughter were in that same situation, should she  go to the school authorities or the police.  I asked the question to put other parents on notice that bad things can happen to our daughters.  I went to the police-not an easy experience and it did not lead to initial prosecution but, looking back, I am glad that I did it.  I think that any school has a conflict of interest in trying to adjudicate the issue.  I hope that all girls who have been raped realize that the rape does not define them,  They will be able to come to terms with the crime that has been done to them.|~|3|~|Wednesday, May 7, 2014 11:40 PM|~|1374559011|~|NA|~|0

He'll instantly get carted off to prison where he's likely to get raped himself, you immediately send a signal to all future rapists that rape is not okay and that as a rapist you will face life-altering punishment if you commit such an act, you document the incident so that there is no "wondering" about whether you were actually raped or just a girl crying rape, and you actually have the gumption to put yourself out there for the benefit of countless women who will be empowered by seeing a real rapist put to shame.

64338|~|'13|~|I think this column hits upon some of my troubles with writing sem. However, I think my worries about writing seminar lie in the ability to improve the writing abilities of all students. I spoke with my own writing seminar professor (lecturer?) and others, and they said they struggled in the class to strike a balance in how much "writing" to teach. Some of the students in their class already wrote at a college (and Princeton) level, while some were years behind. No fault at all of the students, but the teachers with whom I spoke found it difficult to teach enough writing basics to those who needed help while still engaging those who had learned college-level writing in high school. Office hours helped, they said, but they still never found enough time to help the less fluent writers in the classes. This difficult balance may be one reason why some writing seminars tend to focus more on the subject matter than the act of writing.|~|2|~|Wednesday, April 30, 2014 10:15 AM|~|1362330591|~|NA|~|0

64185|~|anon|~|Language classes are tiny. Maybe Mr. Sagiv doesn't quite realize this, since he seems not to have taken one here. I'm in an introductory language class right now for a less-popular language-- we have three people in our class. It's great. If we had more people in our class who weren't dedicated to doing the work or showing up half the time, then they'd be slowing the rest of us down. It's hard work keeping up with a 101/102 language course if you haven't studied that language before. And if you're not keeping up with the work, you're going to force the class to spend more time reviewing old concepts, wasting the time of the other students. This isn't an issue in big lecture classes with little to no interaction among students or between students and teachers. If you don't pay attention one week in ECO100, you're only screwing yourself. If you don't pay attention one week in (language)101, you're screwing everyone. If you're serious about learning a language at Princeton, you'll make time for taking it for a grade. If you're not serious about learning a language, that's fine, just stay out of the classes and don't slow down the people who are serious. Grab an "Intro to" or "Teach Yourself" book from Firestone or Labyrinth instead. Or do some sort of course over the summer when you might have more time.|~|6|~|Tuesday, April 29, 2014 12:13 AM|~|1360107852|~|NA|~|0

64185|~|alumna|~|Learning a language is all about commitment. It's not something you can do from time to time, you need to immerse yourself. That's why 101/102 language classes are scheduled 5 times a week. If you expect to be able to speak a language fluently after 2-3 years worth of classes, then you have to give 100%, not 50% (even if giving 100% might only get you a B+). I doubt the author would like to take Chinese for a year on pass/fail and then discover he can't keep up with the conversations or understand what the instructor is saying in class if he decides to take the second year classes. Language classes rapidly move from instruction in English to instruction in the language of choice. Taking a language class pass/fail might prove disastrous for the student's future prospects of studying the language. Doing work to barely pass the class can only lead to embarrassment when the student won't have the slightest clue of what's going on and might not even understand the instructions on an exam (especially for Asian languages). There's a reason why language classes require close to 100% attendance. The author should speak after he has a clue how college language classes work. I took three years of Japanese at Princeton and I can say that experience is definitely one of the highlights of my Princeton years. But had I not given close to 90-100% I would most certainly have been forced to quit studying the language after a year (or less) from embarrassment at slowing down everyone else taking the class if nothing else.|~|0|~|Sunday, May 4, 2014 4:00 AM|~|1368837698|~|NA|~|0

While many students want to solve their own problems, there are times when it is really helpful and relieving to speak to a trained professional who listens without judgement or biases.  They can help students to get back on their feet so they can resume their lives and studies.  I don't believe that CPS's primary purpose is to protect itself from liabilities.  The whole purpose for CPS is to offer support to all students who at times, might need a little emotional lift.  I believe that their efforts are sincere.  CPS's outreach programs can only be successful if students actually participate where together, they can make programs better and more suited for the students.  I suggest that if you have been hearing negative rumors about CPS, check it out for yourself.|~|11|~|Thursday, April 24, 2014 9:33 PM|~|1354475144|~|NA|~|0
63793|~|Unconvinced.|~|I agree that CPS is a wonderful resource for students dealing with mild to moderate mental health issues. (It really is!!!!) BUT when it comes to more serious mental health, what does CPS do? Dr. Chin assures us that CPS lets students retain autonomy: "Even in cases where a student needs a higher level of care, such as inpatient hospitalization, many students are able to return to campus, transition to the infirmary service of University Health Services and then resume their studies. In such instances, CPS staff work closely with the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students and the Graduate School to figure out the right algorithm of student support, which may include a reduced course load, extensions on assignments and a care plan that supports the student’s resumption of studies." But then how do you explain away what happened to this student? (LINK:  http://dailyprincetonian.com/n...  He had the support of his psychiatrist, who said it was "in his best interest" to REMAIN at Princeton, the support of his professors, with whom he had worked out a plan to pass ALL his classes even after a three week break. He TRIED to get a reduced course load, but Princeton denied him. He OFFERED to live with his mom off-campus, but Princeton banned him altogether, until he was forced to withdraw because he had missed too many classes (that he wasn't allowed to attend.) And that's only the beginning. This doesn't follow with the picture that Dr. Chin painted for us above. Until CPS and the Princeton administration can explain this self-contradiction, I will continue to advocate for policy changes on behalf of the scared and silent students with more severe mental health struggles... because in this battle, the University is their foe, not their friend.|~|6|~|Thursday, April 24, 2014 11:45 PM|~|1354597060|~|NA|~|0

63793|~|Family|~|With all due respect Dr. Chin, your comments don't address the very real concerns that have been raised about the effectiveness and confidentiality afforded to students by counseling services.  Speaking from a parent perspective, CPS was not effective for my child in addressing stress and stress management, and spent a lot of time talking about feelings (over and over again in every session) without taking seriously development of a plan to address it. More importantly, the University as a whole (and I include other elements of University policy) has an intrusive approach to students around issues like health or mental health concerns. Following a physical health related leave, the University mandated a checkin with our child's professors to make sure "things were going okay." It was nonnegotiable, and honestly both unnecessary and, in my view, a violation of HIPPA and personal privacy rights. |~|4|~|Friday, April 25, 2014 11:47 AM|~|1355193431|~|NA|~|1

63793|~|AIS|~|I really appreciate Dr. Chin's reasoned, compassionate response to the concerns being raised in our community about mental health care.  Having worked with  therapists at CPS, I know they are caring and absolutely have the well-being of students at the fore.  Students are told during the first appointment what the limits of confidentiality are. Having worked with therapists in private practice as well, it seems to me that the standards of confidentiality are the same regardless of the setting. Also, these discussions highlight to me the differential attitudes towards psychological vs. medical care and recommendations in our society. Why are we more willing to make solo treatment decisions, disregarding and denigrating professional opinion, about our mental health in a way we probably wouldn't about other physical health concerns? To me, one of the issues is not whether someone could conceivably do well in courses while dealing with severe mental health concerns, but rather should they?  Sometimes, we need to take time to focus on our health and well-being rather than sucking it up and forcing ourselves to get through a semester. I know this idea might be anathema to some but I believe it teaches the important life-lesson of self-care and is a sign of strength not weakness.  Self-care being another idea that may be foreign in our "work hard, play hard" Princeton culture.|~|3|~|Friday, April 25, 2014 12:07 PM|~|1355221176|~|NA|~|1

I support this stance for the overall benefit and safety of the total university population.  In the same regard, I do believe that CPS is always first and foremost acting in the best interest of the student despite some opinions to the contrary.

It's a fact of life, though, that males on average are more visually oriented than girls and correspondingly, that girls are more likely to choose clothing that might 'distract' others. It's exponentially more rare for men to wear abnormal or revealing clothing than it is for women (just look at the clothing stores). We assume when we hear of rape that it's a man raping a woman, because the vast majority of cases are. Likewise, we assume in dress code violations that the subject is more likely to be a female, because female dress has so many more options (including many which are deliberately designed to draw males' attention). We can moralize about how things should be philosophically whole and fair, but we shouldn't seem so shocked when day-to-day reality causes situations like this one that are more concerned with pragmatism.  If there was a trend where guys walked around school in nothing but jock straps, we could be sure that something about that would get added to schools' dress codes. The fact is that most distracting clothing trends seem to target women, for well-known biological reasons.|~|5|~|Tuesday, May 27, 2014 4:48 PM|~|1407224064|~|NA|~|1

63361|~|BadLuckGirl|~|Proposal for a new policy regarding students on a mental health leave of absence: when the student decides they are ready to come back, Princeton may require their private therapist to give signed affirmation that they are mentally fit to return. No more, no less. No information about what caused the student to seek therapy in the first place, no information about how they are responding to treatment, just "Yes, the student is ready to return." This allows Princeton to get the reassurance they need that the student will be well-equipped to handle the rigors of life at their university, while giving students the comfort and autonomy that is crucial to the recovery process in so many mental health cases. Princeton does have a legitimate interest in protecting the well-being of its community, but students also have a legitimate interest in the privacy of their mental health records, and the administration must respect that. This will not solve all of the issues that surround CPS, but it would be a step in the right direction, and it would be a showing of good faith from the university that they understand and respect their students' needs.|~|20|~|Wednesday, April 23, 2014 10:24 AM|~|1351833306|~|NA|~|0

63361|~|'14|~|Is the waiver only for readmission or does it apply while you're also a student? I think the motivation behind having someone at CPS be familiar with your treatment is in case of campus emergencies or based on reports from peers/faculty that come through the administration. With an illness like depression for instance, a student may be particularly unwilling to receive help when depressed. If a student is reported to have missed class for the last 3 weeks or whatever by a professor then it may be more expedient to have someone at CPS be able to communicate with your off campus provider. In the case of an emergency on campus, it may be much quicker to communicate with someone who knows you already. I agree that for readmission the above suggestion may be appropriate, but I can also see that there are unique concerns when it comes to mental illness that might require some additional cooperation between the various parties involved (off-campus treatment provider, CPS, administration).|~|1|~|Wednesday, April 23, 2014 3:52 PM|~|1352359153|~|1351833306|~|0
63361|~|I know from experience...|~|For cases where the person is still on campus, the student is encouraged to sign the waiver in order to ease the process of communication between different treatment providers. This is fine, in my opinion. And additionally, I've never felt coerced to sign that waiver; it was always a suggestion. But that's not the issue we're dealing with here. It sounds like students returning to campus from a leave of absence are being required to sign that waiver IN ORDER to be considered for readmission. And... this isn't required unless the student took the year off for 'mental health' reasons. If a student leaves to get surgery, for instance, they won't be required to share their private medical records with the Administration when they return. The fact that they ARE requiring it for students coming back after leaving for mental health is the big issue here. Waivers aren't a big deal while the student is still on campus, and even make sense in some cases. But no one is arguing against them, so let's stay on topic with this.|~|3|~|Wednesday, April 23, 2014 4:31 PM|~|1352440333|~|1352359153|~|0
63361|~|'14|~|What I wasn't sure about was if this is a condition for readmission to have this waiver signed for the school year. If it's basically a requirement for your life here as a student (for the reasons I mentioned before), then it would make sense to require it at the time of readmission (rather than risk complications later on if they readmitted a student who refused to sign later) [Also, I should've stated this earlier but I'm not sure I agree with the premise that the administration should have any say here, but I'm attempting to consider the issue from their perspective anyways.] The reason the mental health issue is different than other health issues is that (1) the student will often be his/her own worst enemy in terms of seeking help (due to depression, for instance) and (2) there's already stigma against seeking help. If a student comes back and finds that they're still struggling they could view this as a failure etc. etc. until they're back in a dark place. In that case the administration--CPS communication pipeline may be important. Also, looking at the waiver listed on the UHS site, I am wondering what boxes are checked for each waiver that the student needs to sign and return? The waivers are necessary in order for any information to be relayed from an off-campus provider to CPS and to the administration. However, I think what would be most helpful to students would be assurance that the communication between any healthcare provider and the administration is nothing more than a binary 'Yes this person can handle the stress of returning' or 'No they cant'.|~|0|~|Wednesday, April 23, 2014 9:43 PM|~|1352802443|~|1352440333|~|0
63361|~|I know from experience...|~|Ahhh, okay, I see now why you asked your first question. Thanks for explaining. I have a couple thoughts about this. I don't think it's a requirement that it stays signed throughout the school year--it's only for the readmissions process. In fact, students can technically revoke their consent to release of information (the waiver on the UHS site) at any time. But of course, in order to revoke that consent, the consent needs to be given first. (And this is coerced by the University, because it's "necessary" that the student sign these forms to be considered for readmission.) So, if it's not necessary for the remainder of time a returning student spends on campus, then it really IS only for the readmissions process... Yeah, I agree. Wouldn't it be so nice if the administration assured students that the communication would only be a "yes" or "no?" They had the opportunity to do that here, but they didn't. My guess is that it's because the communication isn't always that simple inquiry, as we would hope. ALSO, I looked up that additional, required, "Questions for Treatment Providers" form that was mentioned in the letter (to the author of Monday's op-ed), and could only find it here, in some public records of the lawsuit that's happening with that other princeton guy:  http://www.bazelon.org/LinkCli... The form itself isn't shown, but if you go to item 22 on page 6, you can see a description of what's in it:  "It requires the provider to indicate the dates and type of treatment provided; the medications prescribed; a description of the focus and type of treatment, compliance with treatment, the patient’s presenting concerns and the efficacy of treatment in addressing them, the diagnostic assessment and impressions; an evaluation of whether the patient’s functioning has in the past or is currently compromised by a host of mental health impairments; an assessment of the patient’s readiness to return to school, remaining “functional difficulties or impairments [...]"  etc.... That doesn't sound like a simple "yes" or "no" to me. *sigh* :( I know that mental health issues are different than other health issues, but that still doesn't give universities the right to treat students differently as a result. (And the fact that they do is part of what perpetuates that stigma you mention.) Here's another quote from that same lawsuit, this time on page 9: "Princeton University violated Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by imposing on him conditions of reenrollment that are more onerous and intrusive than it imposes on students who withdraw for reasons of physical illness or disability." Lastly, I'm not sure which boxes need to be checked. Maybe someone else could chime in? Thanks for this conversation; I think it's really constructive and I love that we can talk with each other respectfully.|~|0|~|Thursday, April 24, 2014 1:22 AM|~|1353000457|~|1352802443|~|0
63361|~|'14|~|re: Treatment Providers form This is only released to CPS. (According to the letter in "My lying, smiling face") This then points to the problem of this requirement for an independent evaluation. Why is this needed? Is it to give a CPS person familiarity with a student's case? Does the administration not trust off-campus providers? Do CPS providers have a better understanding of the stresses of Princeton student life? I can't think of a reason that absolutely necessitates this extra evaluation. I'm honestly not sure whether it's right or wrong but I understand the University's concern. What makes most mental health issues (that cause students to leave) different from physical illness / disability is that Princeton is often a major contributing factor of the health problem. In which case, I can understand why they might want absolute assurance that a student has developed the necessary coping mechanisms for student life. I don't know the legal details on if mental illness/disability must be treated exactly the same as physical illness/disability, but I understand why in practice, the readmission process is more onerous and intrusive. One easy step they could take to alleviate student concerns would be to clarify the limits of communication between CPS and the administration. Also, thanks to you too. When I mention that there may be some reasonable justifications behind these misguided policies IRL, I've been met with initial reactions ranging from unhappy to hostile...|~|0|~|Thursday, April 24, 2014 7:54 AM|~|1353364332|~|1353000457|~|0
63361|~|I know from experience...|~|True, the specific form is only released to CPS, but the student is still required to grant permission for CPS to talk to administrators. So then you're absolutely right that the heart of the matter is how much communication will happen between CPS and the administration. And again, I'm very disappointed that they passed up the opportunity to clarify that for everyone in this letter to the editor, and I have to wonder why that was the case. Something I would be really happy with is if they outlined the policy process for students, something along the lines of:  "1) If you need help or are stressed about anything, feel free to come to CPS and talk with any of our trained counselors. You can be certain that confidentiality will be maintained..." "2) If the problem seems persistent, we might refer you to an outside counselor/psychiatrist..." "3) If the situation worsens, we will discuss options with you and you may be encouraged to take time off, but as long as you're seeking help we want to support you..." And then they could describe what scenario could *potentially* result in a mandatory withdrawal. (e.g. an actual suicide attempt) ...or something like that. And I don't know if I've made this clear enough, but I do agree with you on the fact that there could be "reasonable justifications" for their policies. But... my view on the matter is that, though these policies might *seem* okay in theory/on paper, they unfortunately cause students to lose their trust in CPS when the policies are applied in real life, and this reality is too dangerous for the administration to ignore. Like the author of "My Lying, Smiling Face" acknowledged, the solution will need to be innovative and might not be easy to figure out. But that doesn't mean the administration shouldn't at least try.|~|1|~|Thursday, April 24, 2014 2:24 PM|~|1353902924|~|1353364332|~|0

63361|~|'14|~|The outcome of your policy to disregard students' confidentiality is that students will avoid going to CPS altogether out of fear that CPS will share the contents of the counseling sessions with ODUS, Res Colleges, etc. If someone at the university is going to make a determination that a student is unfit to be enrolled here, it should be the medical professionals at CPS (Ideally, it would be an independent professional who is not under the influence of the university). You, as administrators, have no expertise in mental health matters, and therefore you are no more qualified to decide if the student should be enrolled here than the student him/herself.|~|16|~|Tuesday, April 22, 2014 11:22 PM|~|1351316383|~|NA|~|0

Suspicion of bias isn't enough; the school has to either know of facts that contradict the facts relied on by the treating health care provider or know of facts that the the treating health care provider failed to consider." (citation here:  http://yaledailynews.com/weeke... So in light of this, how should we think about what Cherrey wrote in this response letter? ("When a student is under the care of an outside physician or other health professional, we want to learn whatever that person can tell us, but we cannot delegate the decision about whether to encourage a student to leave or whether to permit a student to return solely to that person, to the student or to the student’s family.")

63361|~|BadLuckGirl|~|It's an interesting question. I think most people would say that, because it is a condition on a contractual agreement into which the student voluntarily enters, it is valid. However, if Princeton approached a student who was attending the school in good standing, and threatened to expel them if they didn't reveal their mental health records, I think most people would label that coercion, and any resultant contractual agreement would be voidable by the student, since the student would not have legal capacity to enter the contract under that level of duress.

63361|~|Research|~|I spent several hours trying to research some questions that were raised in the comments section for this article, but since it that discussion is buried in a long thread, I figure most people won't see it. So I'm posting the relevant information here as a separate comment, just in case anyone is interested. (1) Regarding whether the University is *really* asking for *that* much information from a student's counselor while at home.... (AKA, is it a big deal that the student has to sign over confidentiality? Or will there simply be a "yes" or "no" conversation, with respect to whether the student is ready to return?) I tried to look up that additional, required, "Questions for Treatment Providers" form that was mentioned in the letter to the author of Monday's column, but could only find it in some public records of the lawsuit that's happening with that other Princeton student. (It's interesting that this can't be found on the internet... almost as if Princeton doesn't want the world to know that this form exists.) The form itself isn't shown, but if you go to item 22 on page 6, you can see a description of what's in it:  "It requires the provider to indicate the dates and type of treatment provided; the medications prescribed; a description of the focus and type of treatment, compliance with treatment, the patient’s presenting concerns and the efficacy of treatment in addressing them, the diagnostic assessment and impressions; an evaluation of whether the patient’s functioning has in the past or is currently compromised by a host of mental health impairments; an assessment of the patient’s readiness to return to school, remaining 'functional difficulties or impairments' [...]"  etc.... LINK:  http://www.bazelon.org/LinkCli... (2) Students with mental illnesses can't be treated differently than students with physical illnesses, according to this lawsuit: "Princeton University violated Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by imposing on him conditions of reenrollment that are more onerous and intrusive than it imposes on students who withdraw for reasons of physical illness or disability." LINK:  http://www.bazelon.org/LinkCli... And an additional interesting tidbit, (3) Students can't be forced to involuntarily withdraw if they are a danger to themselves. This would require that they are a danger to *others*, according to the new "direct threat" regulation in Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

It would be great if we could better understand the process the University uses in these cases, and the philosophy upon which it is base.  In particular, the University should seek to show how their process and actions compare to best practices at other universities, and how they fit with relevant legal statutes and case law.  I assume much of this is too tedious for me to follow, but I also assume the University has already undertaken such an analysis(whether out of intellectual curiosity or liability mitigation), such that it would be worth sharing.|~|0|~|Tuesday, April 22, 2014 10:32 PM|~|1351273676|~|NA|~|0

62987|~|Changes need to be made|~|This University is a pressure cooker and everyone deals with the stress differently. I think it'd be stupid for the University to assume that only a subset of the students go through struggles like this when in reality it's probably almost everyone.  By focusing on protecting their asses, they aren't protecting the students. Why anyone would reach out to CPS at this point is beyond me besides that it is free. |~|37|~|Sunday, April 20, 2014 11:28 PM|~|1348021170|~|NA|~|0
62987|~|'15|~|I was actually about to write something along the same lines at this when I cam across your comment. I completely agree with this. Princeton it a huge pressure cooker that leaves us all vulnerable. The university is not protecting its students, and the administration needs to admit that the environment that we students live in is neither healthy or normal. When in human existence has it been considered normal to boast about sleeping for only 20 hours in one week? That's not normal. It's sick, and it breeds a toxic environment.|~|7|~|Tuesday, April 22, 2014 8:00 AM|~|1350111300|~|1348021170|~|0
62987|~|Q|~|Thank you for writing the words a lot of us don't know how to verbalize, even when we're screaming them in our heads. Although I ultimately chose not to take a year off, there was a point in my Princeton career when I would wake up and wish I hadn't; when I would cross the street and wish a car would take the choice out of my hands; when I'd open the screen of the bathroom window and wonder what would happen if I just leaned out a couple more inches. Although I was seeing a counselor at CPS regularly, I never once verbalized these thoughts. I couldn't afford a therapist in the community, and so I carefully analyzed every sentence before I spoke it out loud. Every time a CPS person would ask a seemingly innocuous question ("Have you thought about hurting yourself recently; Is there anything more you'd like to say") I'd vigorously shake my head, smile, and say: "Of course I don't think about those things. I'm not like that." But I was like that. Eventually I found my own form of self-therapy, not through drugs or CPS. I was lucky that my mind began to heal itself, and I recovered. Depression is an illness, not a bad choice we make. Making us fear asking for help is like making us fear telling the doctor about a lump we found. It physically pains me to think about the students here who fear to say those few words. I would personally be their confidante, but we don't even have a student group for that. We have anonymous peers at SHARE, but we don't have peers we can tell our most life-threatening problems to. Like sexual harassment/assault, depression is not at the fault of the victim. I will be ashamed of to say I attend this university if they continue to ignore a problem they have perpetuated.|~|28|~|Monday, April 21, 2014 12:21 AM|~|1348181113|~|NA|~|0

Then it is the admin's responsibility to protect that suicidal student AND everyone else on campus. Say that something does happen, and that student hurts himself/others. Then what would everyone say? People wouldn't be so defensive of letting a student with apparent suicidal ideation staying on campus. I'm sure there is a lot more to the story than what is revealed in this article. The University just cannot give personal details because they need to protect the student's confidentiality.|~|1|~|Monday, April 28, 2014 11:34 PM|~|1360082601|~|1348070391|~|0

62987|~|'16|~|I'm currently on gap year for similar reasons, though my mental health situation was no where near as severe as yours. And while I was already aware of the gap year/readmissions process bc I mean, I'm going through it, your article reminded me of something that's really disturbing: I was able to be completely honest during my treatment and not really worry about the implications for my readmission because my symptoms weren't severe enough to pose a "liability" to the university in the first place. I was already struggling a lot and clearly needed help, but I wasn't suicidal nor did I ever want to self-harm, and that might've made all the difference in the way I was treated during my withdrawal (my dean was SUPER helpful and supportive, but if I had been less stable, would she have been?). The fact that there are people out there who are in an even worse condition than I was and are unable/afraid of getting help BECAUSE they're in a worse condition is really twisted. Like, the fact that one of my first reactions to discovering I had depression was "Well, at least I'm not suicidal because then getting back into school would be a LOT harder" says a LOT about what Princeton's mental health system does to us. In addition to its mental health policies, I think another thing that needs to change about Princeton is the stigma surrounding taking time off. Obviously the university shouldn't force anyone to do anything, but time off shouldn't be seen by students as such a dire option in the first place. I didn't consider taking time off until my dean recommended it, and while I at first refused, when I did decide to take time off a few weeks later it ended up being the best decision I made here. While I of course understand being afraid of having to withdraw permanently, I hear about people who are afraid of having to withdraw even for a year, and I think that's a little weird considering the alternative is remaining miserable at a place that will only make you more miserable if you don't get help. Ever since I withdrew and was open about my withdrawal, I've had people who're considering doing the same come to me for advice they're afraid of asking their friends, and people who went on leave of absence after I did have come to me for support that they don't get from friends who don't understand, and that's really saddening to me. When you're dealing with mental health issues, leaving Princeton for a bit can be one of the best/healthiest things you can do, and people shouldn't be so intimidated by it.|~|15|~|Monday, April 21, 2014 1:16 AM|~|1348211560|~|NA|~|0
62987|~|Author|~|Hey! Author here.... Thanks so, so much for your thoughtful comment. I absolutely agree that time off doesn't need to be as scary as it may seem. I was never scared of time off itself, only that I might be forced (or at least, extremely pressured) to make that decision before I was ready to/before I had come to terms with it. I think one of the most frightening aspects of 'time off' for people struggling with mental health is that it removes them from their base of support. That was the number one consideration making me hesitant to leave Princeton... my counselor, my friends, my mentors--they were all here. Not at home. But I made the decision to take a leave of absence anyway, and my fears about leaving my support system were assuaged by my ability to really think things through, over time, with my parents and friends. It was especially helpful that I didn't have to worry about pressure from the administration. If I'd been forced to leave before I was really ready to do so, I'm certain that it would have actually made things worse for me. And for this reason, if I were given the opportunity make the choice again, I would still choose to avoid CPS. Even if they thought time off was better for me in the long run, the short term distress of being forced to leave my friends too early could have sent me over the edge. And to anyone who might be reading this, I want you to know that taking a year off does have the potential to be the best decision you could make. It certainly was for me. Because I took the year off, I was able to attend an Intensive Outpatient Program close to home, and it had a tremendous impact on my recovery. This IOP consisted of three hours of treatment, five days a week; it would have been impossible to do a program this thorough if I had remained at Princeton. '16, back to what you said, I've also had my friends come to me for support and advice about taking time off, and it IS sad that these students don't feel comfortable speaking to their deans or to CPS about the same questions. I really, REALLY hope that this column can help instigate change in Princeton's mental health policy, for the good of the students and the university. That's my goal. And also, a big THANK YOU to everyone else who has commented on this article with their words of support. You've been a huge source of encouragement for me :)|~|12|~|Tuesday, April 22, 2014 7:13 PM|~|1351078572|~|1348211560|~|0

During my sophomore year, when my depression wasn't nearly as bad, I went to CPS regularly and never had to worry about "saying the wrong thing" or whatever. They're almost always really nice, compassionate and helpful when it comes to helping out students. The only time you'd have to worry about whether to "censor" what you say is if things get really severe (and I mean REALLY severe), in which case I'd suggest you see an off-campus counselor.|~|0|~|Tuesday, April 29, 2014 2:30 PM|~|1361179930|~|1360976750|~|0

62987|~|Briana Wilcox|~|I also went to CPS often for my freshman and sophomore years, and I also self-censored during therapy because I knew better than to admit impulses to self-harm. Instead of scratching myself with a pen cap, I would ink/carve messages of support into my own arms and wear long sleeves. Instead of crashing my bike, I would sit on a rooftop accessible to my dorm window and wonder whether three stories was high enough to do the job. I also feared taking time off; a whole year of nothing to do but think- about my nightmares, my despair, my failure to even be a "normal" college student- would have been its own hell. At least at school I had extracurriculars and friends to distract me.  In my experience, taking time off was essentially an admission of weakness and inadequacy. I would finally be admitting that I did not belong at Princeton, was not good enough, and would never be. I wasn't in a healthy enough state to wrestle with that, so I opted to lie and continue dragging myself through 4 consecutive years. Now that I'm out, I'm so much happier, and I find myself referring to my time at Princeton as "serving time" whenever anyone asks about my ritzy degree. I was one of the lucky ones who found other ways to cope: I befriended good people, I took smaller, upper-division classes, I stopped caring whether I was "the best" or "good enough", and I fell into the best relationship I've ever had in one of the best people I've ever met. They all worked to save my life, and I am grateful. I can't even imagine what life would be like for the unlucky. Princeton habitually fails people like me and lies about it. I don't understand why. I just know that I'm not donating a single cent until they actually comply with Title IX (wrt addressing sexual assault, gender-based harassment, and LGBT hate crimes) and make meaningful change to support students' mental health, not destroy it.  I was fine before I went to Princeton. Since leaving Princeton, I've continued struggling to recover from my experiences there and trying not to let it limit my options moving forward. Who knows, maybe I'll be one of the lucky ones.|~|3|~|Wednesday, April 23, 2014 6:54 PM|~|1352630830|~|NA|~|0

It's time they openly seek after and praise the qualities you've clearly exhibited (strength, resilience,  perseverance and the initiative to seek help) especially in the context of mental health which is such an important issue on ours and all college campuses. Student health, NOT university image, should be the administration's number one priority.|~|2|~|Wednesday, April 23, 2014 9:09 PM|~|1352769600|~|NA|~|0
62987|~|Tired|~|Any mental health care professional worth their salt would NEVER disclose any specifics of therapy to a University regardless of any waiver you sign.  They will say, "Yes person X is doing well and can handle school" or they will say, "No, in my experience, this person should not be under pressure at school."  They won't say, "Jimmy told me about this time he thought about crashing his bike into the stairs."  It just doesn't work that way.  No one should be afraid to seek help from a professional because you are worried the university will find out about it and somehow use this against you.  Likewise, no one should lie in therapy or withhold because you think it will get back to the university.  I get the fear and I get why you might be worried about what you say.  But therapy won't do you any good if you don't trust your therapist.  If you don't believe me, ask them flat out.  Ask them what they will or won't do and whether or not you can trust them.  It's a meaningful conversation to have and might help put you at ease.|~|2|~|Wednesday, April 23, 2014 7:14 PM|~|1352653020|~|NA|~|1

62987|~|Chiming in|~|I'm part of a comment thread on the April 23rd response letter that addressed some of your questions, so I want to chime in here with some relevant details. Regarding whether health care professionals can choose to reveal nothing other than their opinion... that's not entirely true, unfortunately. It's not just a discussion over the phone, for instance. I decided to try to look into the required "Questions for Treatment Providers" form that was briefly mentioned in the letter to the author (above), but could only find it in some public records of the lawsuit that's happening with that other Princeton student who was banned from campus. (It's interesting that this form can't be found on the internet... almost as if Princeton doesn't want the world to know that this form exists.) The form itself isn't shown in this document, but if you go to item 22 on page 6, you can see a description of what's in it: "It requires the provider to indicate the dates and type of treatment provided; the medications prescribed; a description of the focus and type of treatment, compliance with treatment, the patient’s presenting concerns and the efficacy of treatment in addressing them, the diagnostic assessment and impressions; an evaluation of whether the patient’s functioning has in the past or is currently compromised by a host of mental health impairments; an assessment of the patient’s readiness to return to school, remaining 'functional difficulties or impairments' and whether those impairments would 'contraindicate or make more difficult a return to a high-stress academic environment.' [...]"  etc.... LINK:  http://www.bazelon.org/LinkCli... This is definitely more in-depth than a simple "yes" or "no." (My favorite part of that form is that it uses the word "contraindicate"--that's so quintessentially Princeton, haha.)|~|1|~|Thursday, April 24, 2014 4:46 PM|~|1354138205|~|1353975073|~|0

They make a health professional disclose about you, because they know that 20 year olds LIE.  YOU LIED.  CASE IN POINT.  They don't want to admit someone that keeps LYING about their condition.  They need the truth that you're actually okay, that you laid out all the issues with someone and it is mostly resolved and that you are ok.  The school has not rejected you so far.  No one has rejected (officially) so far.  *YOU ARE AFRAID OF THAT*  Fear is driving too much of the content of this article.  That is tough to deal with.  Sometimes, it comes from your sense of how you really are right now, but also a lot more fear, too.  If you're not a perfect shape, uncertainty will always be there.  Either get better or cope with uncertainty better, because the policies will probably stay the same by the time you try to get readmitted.|~|3|~|Monday, April 21, 2014 12:31 AM|~|1348188112|~|NA|~|0
62987|~|Your comment is unhelpful|~|Aside from the fact that shouting at the author in all caps, "YOU LIED," is definitely not nice, I also think you're missing the point of the article entirely. You say "the stigma is not coming [from] them" but it is. The "fear" you refer to is coming from them, and this, in a way, contributes to the stigma on campus by unintentionally communicating the idea that "you're not welcome here because of your struggles." Additionally, you said that the school has not rejected the author yet, but again, you're missing the point. Even though the author wasn't forced to leave, other students were, as pointed out by 'ala' in their comment.

You're "lying" by concealing your name on a public forum while attacking someone who has gone out of their way to tell their story. You seem to want to punish everyone but yourself for this sin of lying. If I didn't know for sure, I'd think that you were projecting. In medicine, we know people lie all the time. It's just a fact of life. You can't punish everyone for lying. Neither should Princeton. Neither should you. Mental illness is not like a cold or broken bone. You might never truly recover from the damage. It can take years. Even when you are stable enough to begin work, you will struggle. Self-acceptance and external support allows you to rebuild your world. What is important is that the person thinks that they are ready to go back. My sib had a series of medical problems requiring surgery that distracted him while attending UCLA. He decided to take a year out. He's now working as a software developer at a major corporation, building up his confidence to return to UCLA. Thankfully UCLA believes in your record and milestones instead of requiring you to sign away your rights to patient-doctor confidentiality.|~|5|~|Monday, April 21, 2014 2:53 PM|~|1349140407|~|1348188112|~|0

It's hilarious that GoodluckGirl thinks that mental health professionals who violate doctor-patient confidentiality (because of the university's liability-driven policies) deserve the trust and honesty of students. This is Princeton...everyone going to CPS is smart enough to LOGICALLY withhold information if/when it will be abused and used against them - that is not some 20 year old ploy to manipulate and it's not just a result of this individual's "condition." I didn't find this article to be fear driven, and obviously the author is not alone (check out the citations and many comments from others who have experienced the same - i.e. the student who got kicked off campus just because he WAS COMPLETELY HONEST about his suicide attempt...but his psychiatrist and professors supported him and stated he was well enough to cope/recover and stay on campus...he got kicked off campus anyway by the administration. Just one example of the university using HONESTY against students). "Either get better or cope with uncertainty better" - just wow. Those kinds of directives are really helpful *sarcasm*...but seriously, statements like that have an implied assumption that mental health patients can just flip a switch to get better, and are completely unfair and harsh.|~|18|~|Monday, April 21, 2014 1:07 AM|~|1348206702|~|1348191065|~|0

It is unfortunate that it is invasive, and I'm truly sorry if that contributes negatively to your experience, but Princeton is not a place where you should be simultaneously battling an onslaught of work as well as suicidal tendencies. This place is a pressure cooker. It seems harsh for them to strongly urge a leave of absence, but that is in all honesty the most sensible response to those feelings. Mental rehabilitation takes time and patience. I nonetheless think it's important that the University places a lot of value on the mental health of its students. And yes, asking a suicidal student to take time off is the best advice the University could give.|~|1|~|Monday, April 28, 2014 4:45 AM|~|1358724621|~|NA|~|0
62987|~|Dissenting to the dissent|~|Why do people keep referring to Princeton as a pressure cooker? Whenever someone does that, it ends up portraying people who suffer from mental health as simply "the ones who couldn't withstand the pressure." Not only is that severely reductionist (because it ignores the role of biological aspects), but it's also a huge part of what contributes to the stigma. (Students are afraid of being perceived as "not strong enough" emotionally/mentally) Also, you keep saying the University is "strongly urging" students to leave or giving "advice" to take time off, but that's not what students are worried about. They're worried about when the university FORCES them to leave, regardless of what's actually best for them. Consider, for example, the student who only has health insurance through the university, who can't see a psychologist or psychiatrist unless they're on campus and whose treatment would be cut off if they have to go home. (But Princeton doesn't care.) Or, consider the student whose problems stem from broken family relationships, and for whom being sent back home could be the worst thing to happen for their mental and emotional well-being. (But Princeton doesn't care.) And what about the student who was actively seeking help, and had support from both his long-term psychiatrist and his professors? (But Princeton didn't care, and banned him from campus anyway.) Listen, I'm not saying that time off really is the best plan for most students. But sometimes, it's the worst plan. And even if that's only the case for maybe one or two students a year, the fact that Princeton forces them to leave anyway is what's causing people to fear CPS, and subsequently this is why the campus is becoming an increasingly dangerous environment for students with severe mental health issues. And THIS is why change is imperative. Sorry if it feels like I singled you out, '15. I'm really just upset about the situation in general and the fact that people keep (accidentally) perpetuating the stigma by reducing the situation to nothing more than Princeton being a "pressure cooker." Each individual situation is unique, and almost every single one is far more complicated than the student falling under the weight of pressure.|~|1|~|Monday, April 28, 2014 12:31 PM|~|1359192254|~|1358724621|~|0
62987|~|15|~|Interesting rebuttal, but stigma or not, having to deal with emotional problems while at the same time being burdened by work will hinder the recovery process. When it comes to mental health (especially suicide), you don't fuck around with "stigmas" and bad perception. Shit just got real as soon as suicide becomes a seriously considered path, and the University health officials DO know better than the person who is suffering from depression. I don't even understand how that point can be argued. Depression limits your ability to make healthy decisions (namely... killing yourself!)|~|0|~|Thursday, May 1, 2014 5:26 AM|~|1363675825|~|1359192254|~|0

62987|~|Anonymous|~|I'm grateful this important and powerful column was published. It's so true that students fear going to CPS with their most serious mental health issues--last year I was one of them. On one particularly bad night, I was having severe self-harm thoughts, but neither of the two friends I had tried to call picked up. As a last resort, I tried to call the national suicide hotline, thinking that speaking with a stranger would be better than speaking with no one at all. But after a couple rings, an automated voice started to say, "please wait while we transfer you to a nearby..." and I freaked out. I hung up immediately, thinking that if they knew where I was (in order to let me talk to a nearby crisis center), they might come and get me. And then, if the people at the crisis center came and got me, I was sure that Princeton would kick me out, just as they had for several other students who went to the hospital for suicidal thoughts or attempts. Fortunately, I tried one of my friends again, and this time they picked up... but it definitely left me rattled to realize I couldn't even call an "anonymous" hotline for fear that I'd have to leave campus. Someone might think that it was "irrational" for me to assume that Princeton would force me to withdraw if they found out about my phonecall. After all, that only happened to a few people... But tell me, is a student in a situation like this really thinking rationally? When it comes down to life or death, students need to be able to trust the university. I didn't trust them, but I was lucky enough to have friends who pick up their phones at 3am. Not everyone is so lucky, though.|~|1|~|Sunday, April 27, 2014 10:55 AM|~|1357723222|~|NA|~|0

62684|~|Dean  Bogucki|~|Our curriculum focuses on the fundamentals of engineering,with an aim of educating students for a career, rather than training for a first job.  This focus on the principles of engineering is perhaps the genesis of the things the author has heard about Princeton engineering, since we start from the principles and then move to the applications, rather than the other way around.  There's nothing theoretical about these principles:  the laws of thermodynamics, for example, can't be repealed.  We also educate students with broad interests, who take full advantage of the liberal arts setting here at Princeton.  This has proven to be an effective approach, as our alumni have generally been quite successful as leaders in many different fields.   Adding applied courses in freshman year would displace the humanities and social science electives that most BSE students came to Princeton to take. I'm not sure where the author has gotten the idea that attrition from the BSE program is increasing.  In fact, there is a steady stream of freshman and sophomore AB students into the BSE program, which offsets the number of students who switch to AB.    Here is a fact:  we began with 331 BSE students in the Class of 2017 in September.   As of today, there are 321.    Some more will leave by the end of sophomore year, which is natural, but certainly not to the degree that the author asserts.

Of course the theory is important and it plays a large role in why Princeton engineers are so successful, but only theory makes johnny a dull boy. You need to keep the imagination and excitement there and that's what a design project would do. The same way every freshman has to take writing sem, every freshman engineer should have to take some sort of super hands on, small engineering seminar where they could work with each other and a faculty member in a small group building things and preparing for their senior project. Not only would this be a useful class, but it could help give BSE students an experience with real practical engineering.|~|12|~|Wednesday, April 16, 2014 11:02 PM|~|1342319942|~|1342252416|~|0

Mike's assertion was that 1/3 of students will drop engineering their freshman year, citing no source for that number.  You affirm that by quoting a ballpark number you found on the admissions page. Dean Bogucki, the undergraduate dean of the engineering school himself, gave exact numbers stating that only 10 students have dropped engineering since September--that's only 3%.

Freshmen don't have the practical research ability, writing ability, critical thinking skills, or well-developed biceps to write a thesis. Maybe a few could because they went to a good school, but we can't cater to them. Same thing with engineers. This isn't daycare. Classes aren't here to be fun so we can have a good time building crafts. Because honestly if a freshman tried to build a project that's what it would be. How would I design an airplane if I couldn't even code? I could make my shampoo bottle fly if I got a big enough engine to tape to it but what the fuck does that teach me? How to buy an engine and how to use duct tape? But I had fun! Now I'm going to be a real engineer! Well let me tell you what, what the fuck kind of engineer welds anymore?? I don't know, I'm sure there are some jobs where being able to machine would be great (which you would have known if you had stuck with MAE), but in the vast majority of engineering jobs, you'll be sitting in front of a computer all day, hate to break it to you. Yeah, building stuff is valuable, but mostly because it shows companies you can work in a team, you have interesting design ideas, and you are interested enough to go above and beyond, and maybe join an extracurricular where you make stuff.

It sounds like he wants them to do more lab work, which is hardly beyond the efforts of freshmen. They do it in science classes all the time. Why can't they do it in engineering classes?|~|1|~|Thursday, April 17, 2014 3:08 PM|~|1343271169|~|1342836438|~|0
62684|~|MAE '14|~|That's fair, but we also do a lot of lab work in intro classes. At least for MAE, we have lots of lab work starting sophomore year. As for freshman year, you do lab work in physics and probably chemistry too. Then your other required classes are math and COS, not much hands on work to do there. If you want, you can get more of a feel for the lab by doing integrated science. Finally, you can do whatever in your free time - there's a lot of project-based extracurriculars. But there also is a difference between natural sciences and engineering. If you go on to do be a scientist, you're probably working in a lab. But an engineer is probably not going to be using the "practical skills" learned in the machine shop in their job. It is good to have them to understand what goes into manufacturing and how to design things which can easily be made, but it's not something necessary day to day.|~|2|~|Thursday, April 17, 2014 4:48 PM|~|1343682226|~|1343271169|~|0

62684|~|MAE I still love you <3|~|Perhaps it is true that engineers today do no really get to do all the welding and machining, however I do think it is important for them to have a foundation and basic understand of that. In my case, for example, I came to realize that I like theory, but I really dislike having to do the hands on work. I don't like going to the machine shop, and I hate going to lab. And I am considering not working as a mechanical engineer, partially because of that. Are you telling me that that is completely irrelevant, and I could and should still work as an engineer even though I would never want to even consider doing the hands on work? From what I have been reading in some job postings, many jobs today for engineers are still expected to have some -even minimal- hands on components, I don't think everything is left to the mechanics. Even if most of the time it would be in front of a computer, they are sometimes required to plan the manufacturing process - that requires knowledge of the machines and tools and techniques and what not-, or at least identifying and handling parts... I personally believe that if Princeton had asked me to do design projects earlier in my Princeton career, perhaps I would have switched out of MAE just in time, something I cannot do anymore. As much as I love my fellow MAEs and I have learned to really appreciate the major, I am not quite sure it's my thing, and I came to that realization after the hands on and lab requirements over these last two years thanks to the design classes.|~|0|~|Friday, April 18, 2014 6:46 PM|~|1345609765|~|1343682226|~|0

62684|~|Andrew Houck|~|The author’s main hypothesis – that the structure of Princeton’s engineering curriculum biases students towards non-technical jobs – is intriguing, but does not seems to be born out by fact.  A cursory glance at career statistics for our peer institutions shows that their student career choices mirror our own (for instance, 12% of MIT students go into finance, 12% into consulting).  A significant fraction of engineering students at all top schools pursue finance jobs, not because they are bored of engineering, but because they are highly sought-after, highly compensated, and in many cases, enjoy the work and environment. Putting that aside, many faculty empathize with the author’s desire for more hand-on learning in early stages of engineering education, and this is reflected in ongoing changes brought about by SEAS, the Keller Center, and the various engineering departments.  As departmental representative for ELE, I am most familiar with the changes going on in electrical engineering.  We have always been quite strong at engaging students in faculty research, but we want to make sure we do more than churn out faculty clones (though really, can there ever be too many of me??).  As such, one of our main strategic goals is to better serve students interested in more applied engineering. To this end, we have recently revamped all of our required courses, making sure that there is a significant lab component to get students hand-on experience starting in sophomore year.  These are not typical one-off three-hour labs, but rather ongoing projects throughout the semester where students build significant and complex systems, learning fundamentals in a more applied way.  We have added sophomore level independent work courses, so students can do independent work for credit starting in sophomore year.  We’ve given students significantly more freedom in CarLab to pursue independent ideas.   We are supporting the hardware side of Hack Princeton in order to foster a culture of engineering outside the classroom.  We are now requiring a senior thesis, and are working hard to make sure that this will be an amazing and defining experience.  We are encouraging students to pursue their own project ideas for their thesis, including in groups and across departmental boundaries where appropriate, and are matching them with faculty members who are excited to mentor students outside their main research area. We are also lucky enough to have generous alumni who enable incredible new initiatives.  Thanks to the Steve Johnson Slingshot Fund, we can offer significant resources to ELE students to pursue entrepreneurial projects or truly unique internship opportunities – we’ve so far offered money for a group of students developing an Android-controlled power strip, another building a new type of 3D touchscreen, another creating a network of e-ink based campus posters, and to send a student to NASA.  We’re also building “nerd kits” for incoming students that include all of the hardware platforms they will use during their required courses, as well as some cool sensors and actuators; they keep these throughout their time here, so they always have access to a variety of new technologies, lowering the bar for tinkering. In short, although I’m not sure it will sway people’s career paths, you’ve touched on something very important to us, and something that will significantly enhance our student’s educational experience. Princeton will never give up on teaching strong fundamentals – the strength of our student’s on fundamentals is perhaps the most frequent compliment I hear from employers – but that doesn’t mean we can’t also engage at a more applied level as well.|~|11|~|Thursday, April 17, 2014 9:57 AM|~|1342797689|~|NA|~|1

62684|~|hlz '14|~|I'd like to add that even if the curriculum remains theory-first, which (in theory) isn't a bad idea, it would be nice to have more support from the University for applied engineering as extracurricular activities. For example, from what I can tell, a lot of MIT's culture of building things exists outside of classes, ranging from makerspaces (MITERS) to more formally organized programs (like Formula SAE). Over the last couple years Princeton hackathons have begun introducing hardware hacking, but attendance and focus is still largely CS/coding based with increasing participation by EE/MAE/etc. PAVE doesn't seem to be doing all that much at the moment, and it's incredibly difficult to acquire funding for engineering projects like Formula SAE (or Formula SAE Electric, which we attempted to start several times) due to immense difficulty acquiring funding and space to work. I think that's generally true for a lot of applied engineering projects that aren't code: you need money, tools, and space to work, and a lot of cool projects get expensive very quickly. The University is in a good position to help out with this sort of thing, and in funding and supporting, for example, a Formula SAE team, it would be joining MIT, Georgia Tech, UM, McGill, Columbia, etc. -- a lot of top engineering schools who are able to attract enthusiastic, hands-on engineers and teach them the fundamentals while giving them plenty of real world engineering opportunities. Basically, making things in CS is cheap - you need a working computer and internet, and you can build what you want. Most of engineering isn't like that, and students would really benefit from more University support for hands-on projects outside of class, which seems like a good way to generate enthusiasm for engineering while still keeping the curriculum theory-focused.|~|5|~|Thursday, April 17, 2014 1:12 AM|~|1342407396|~|NA|~|0

(I hope it grows and does awesomely in the future, but right now it's in its infancy -- if any readers are interested they should get involved!) HLZ's main point -- that there's little institutional support for outside building-things projects -- still stands. I would also love to see more building-things outside of classes.

I also don't think anybody would suggest the SEAS should introduce such broad policies as placing more requirements upon BSE freshmen to take more applied engineering courses before they've declared a major, or trying to create some required general applied engineering classes that all BSE freshmen must take. The engineering departments are too varied. Good engineering courses which emphasize applications exist in every engineering department, and in part it's up to students to seek them out. I think it's reasonable to suggest that BSE freshmen should take more of these engineering classes if they can. Perhaps a couple departments don't structure their curricula in a way that makes this easy, but that's a department-specific problem. In any case, I had no trouble taking a good lab-focused engineering class my freshmen year, and many more since then, and it has worked out well in my personal experience.|~|4|~|Wednesday, April 16, 2014 11:16 PM|~|1342332609|~|NA|~|0

Don't get me wrong, I love the COS department, but I don't see why a design project is not possible as part of a strong, fundamentals-based curriculum. Perhaps, though, this is something that would need to be tackled on a dept-by-dept basis.|~|3|~|Wednesday, April 16, 2014 11:28 PM|~|1342341868|~|NA|~|0

I knew many other switchers, and all of them were switching to something, not running scared of the extra few classes BSE students had to take.|~|2|~|Thursday, April 17, 2014 3:12 PM|~|1343276239|~|NA|~|0

It is possible that the FE part of the ORFE department name is a misnomer - I know many other students that feel the same way as you. However, this not an issue with the academic structure of the department, since the financial side is just an application of the concepts taught in the other core classes. Additionally, even though only one of the core classes is about finance, there are many higher-level ORF electives (with prereqs) and Finance certificate classes (fewer prereqs) that ORF students that are interested in finance often take.|~|2|~|Thursday, April 17, 2014 11:52 AM|~|1342980694|~|1342155863|~|1

62684|~|Christina Rice|~|I really appreciate and sympathy with this article, it may be ambitious and some of the criticisms have merit. However, I am a freshman who has just recently been comparing other engineering curriculum (as well as had the amazing opportunity to experience an engineering curriculum at my high school) and believe the idea of not including some exposure to your major is a flaw that should be addressed. In our first year at Princeton the engineering candidate's are not exposed to engineering but pure math and hard science, while these are useful and tools we'll use for our duration here they are not our major; engineering is something distinctly different - it is design (or sometimes redesign) of structures, machines, systems, etc. We have no exposure to the engineering/design process but our major will determine we do more that analyze or compute. I think it benefit our ability to start thinking about systems as changeable (something we can and will manipulate) and begin to actively reflect on how they work well and how they fall short. While still introducing us to the means by which we will do it with the current curriculum. At risk of offending some physics majors PHY 103/104 is engineering physics and the lab section is already experimenting with updating the lab due to certain shortfalls - we could change this into a design lab (which lends itself well to integration with a physics curriculum given we already have one lab - the AC motor - where we do a little design and it works). Also, shifting some time were requirements could be scheduled might be an option that would not displace a humanities. Beyond this, even if my ideas are imperfect (which they are) we are Princeton - to say something worthwhile, like integrating engineering principles into our freshman teachings, can not be done because a system we created can not be modified…while then we are not as good as engineering as we thought. We have bright minds here and together if this wanted to get done, it would get done.|~|0|~|Sunday, April 27, 2014 12:09 PM|~|1357803384|~|NA|~|1

62287|~|guinnessblaine|~|A reasonable qualification for an action to be "life-saving" is that, as a result of the action, there is less loss of life than there would result from inaction.  In the case of ectopic pregnancies and various other situations in which the chances for survival of the fetus are low to none and the mother is at serious risk, ending the pregnancy results in a reduced loss of life.  That is incredibly straight-forward, to address your first objection about whether such an act could be "life-saving." As to your second question, whether such an action is justifiable is a much hairier debate and rests largely on definitions about at what point life "begins." In a later comment, you state "A human life may never intentionally be taken for the purpose of saving another."  Self-defense and Stand Your Ground statues beg to differ.  In most modern justice systems, protecting the life of another is often a valid defense for ending a life.|~|0|~|Tuesday, April 15, 2014 12:45 PM|~|1338033066|~|1337187883|~|1

62287|~|Bennett McIntosh|~|Thanks, Zach for your response! You're absolutely right to extol the value of the Liberal Arts in and of themselves, and I regret that I failed to make that more clear -- you explained it better than I could have anyway. That said, the two arguments are not as dichotomous as you seem to imply -- a learner who has steeped himself in philosophy or history for the pleasure of the study is more able and likely to be a productive worker and citizen. It should be noted that I didn't mention Evan Draim's name because he had posted anonymously and later removed the post, so I decided it would be unreasonable to attack him by name. I thus repeatedly described Draim's words as "the Tory post," for it was indeed a post on the Tory website, and regret if that implied that the Tory or its Editorial Board endorsed Draim's rhetoric. I look forward to reading your next list this week!|~|17|~|Tuesday, April 15, 2014 9:08 AM|~|1337636841|~|NA|~|1

I can't say what it's like as an international student, but as an African American, I've had many instances where people expect me to give my opinion or sage their curiosity when something pertaining to black people is mentioned.

61951|~|15|~|There are reasons why upperclassmen don't write about the said issues - almost everything there is that needs to be said has been said. Since youre so adamant about upperclassmen not writing, let me make a case for you:  1) Eating clubs and/or bickering are corrupt, arbitrary, inductive to alcoholism and other physically- and mentally-damaging activities, racist/sexist (some more than others but a typical night on the Street usually includes both), elitist and very (though the degree tends to vary) financially burdening. Yeah, you can go independent/join a coop etc. but then again, those alternatives also have downsides (social reasons aka fomo being the primary). Ok. What's news there? If you skim through the recent opinion pieces on these issues, you'll see that I've covered almost every topic that the frosh Prince writers have written about re: eating clubs/bicker. The general tone of these frosh writers seems to be "omg eating clubs are soooo bad but Princeton doesn't do anything about it waaah :("  2) Back to the main topic of this article, choosing majors/classes. There will always been some weird "rivalry" between the humanities and STEM majors about which ones are taking harder classes, which ones have better job prospects etc. There are always STEM majors who call out humanities majors for not doing any work, taking easy classes, having too much "free time" and humanities defending themselves. What's Sagiv adding to the discussion? a) Stop hating on each other, we're all relevant, and b) lol humanities people actually take some hard classes. and he suggests "Clapping for Credit" is an easy A. It's not. But I guess the primary reason this article is so dumb is because a freshman, who is not only undecided as far as majors go but is also far from exploring a variety of options classes-wise, is telling the rest of the school to "explore".

I have been a bit obsessed in keeping up with where this story will go since it is such a poor representation of what I expect from a woman who was fortunate enough to graduate from Princeton.  People do talk, and the talk about her is not flattering.  In fact, it is a bit angering that she was privileged enough to obtain what we could only hope for, and has tarnished everything in our imagination of what a Princeton graduate should be.  I hope this stays alive if only to encourage the young ladies of Princeton today to live up to the reputation that truly reflects the university they are attending.|~|0|~|Monday, April 7, 2014 10:14 PM|~|1323304515|~|1323256648|~|0

I think it's pretty clear that his status as an underrepresented minority, coupled with his compelling application, are what gave him such an 'all kill,' so to speak. again, I believe he truly deserved to get into each school he got into, in the way that we all "deserved" to get into Princeton, but to suggest that race had nothing to do with the fact that EVERY school wanted HIM, is a bit naive.|~|36|~|Monday, April 7, 2014 1:54 AM|~|1322043085|~|NA|~|1

61190|~|Not just merit|~|Look, good for the kid. It sounds like he's smart and worked hard in high school and achieved a reasonable reward. His parents oughtta be proud. The reason this story has so much resonance is the All Eight headline. College applicants are told over and over again that it's a crapshoot, that acceptance to Ivy-caliber schools is random at best even for the top academic achievers, and that rejection happens randomly too. And there are plenty of anecdotal stories that bear that out, about such-and-such a kid with the best scores who got rejected from Cornell or whatever. Under the holistic system, no student can possibly fit the needs of EVERY school in any one year. With so much random churn in the process, getting in to All Eight is a virtual impossibility for anyone - right? Apparently not. As long as you're a reasonably high-achieving black kid with a compelling family story, the randomness doesn't apply. That's the implicit message of the story and why it has gotten so much traction. College admissions is emphatically NOT a meritocracy, but many people believe that it is. Merit matters to some degree, but so do other things. My numbers (2390, 12 AP 5s, etc etc) blew this kid's away, but I certainly didn't get in everywhere I applied (Ivy or otherwise). I'm neither jealous of his choices nor apologizing for taking advantage of what I had to work with: my in at Princeton? Legacy. But it's time everyone recognized that merit is not the determining factor in college admissions that many people believe it to be.|~|19|~|Monday, April 7, 2014 1:01 PM|~|1322615000|~|NA|~|0

The odds of an average application getting in to all eight Ivy league schools, given their published acceptance rates, is about 1 in 391 million. Only about 20,000 apply to the smaller Ivies, and nowhere near all 20,000 of those apply to all eight. At those odds and that population size, the odds of even having one lucky winner are very small. The odds of Mr. Enin's acceptance being due to chance are virtually zero. Thus, his application was clearly special in some way that stood out to every college admissions office.

60893|~|Patricia Lin|~|During my time at Princeton, '87-91, I was also totally alienated by the amazing privilege and wealth of so many of the students. I think probably the four year colleges and the Frist Student Center has helped. But I do not think it helps that the Eating Clubs still play so much of a large role on campus. The pressure to attend one of the Spring activities was huge. The cost of a dress a significant investment in my case.  Princeton needs not merely to let in more academically qualified Pell grant students and underrepresented minority background students, but those from low income and middle income backgrounds from public schools, not from elite private schools. Also start recruiting from Community Colleges. UC Berkeley has done it very successfully for years. And the University needs to actively and wholeheartedly foster a cultural shift to fully embrace socio-economic diversity at all levels, and against unquestioned privilege, which will no doubt dismay some. It has only been with Princeton's Reunions for Women, LGBT and Allies and Diverse Alumni that I have started to feel proud of graduating from Princeton. I received a terrific education there but frankly the social and cultural experience was very isolation and painful. Thankfully for Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor for being willing to be an active trustee and for being honest about her experiences so things can change for the better.|~|10|~|Thursday, April 3, 2014 10:41 AM|~|1316778075|~|NA|~|1

Patricia, I'm not sure how large a role the Eating Clubs played during your time here, but I assure you that they continue to play a disproportionately large role today, especially among upperclassmen. Frist and the residential colleges have failed to become a social center for upperclassmen. Despite being from a solidly middle class family, I couldn't justify asking my parents to pay $8-9k annually when I could eat for less than 1/4 of that, so I joined a co-op instead. While we have some social activities, they are far fewer than what the clubs provide for their members. I often find myself sitting alone in my room on weekend nights, while my roommates are hanging at their clubs. You say that "the social and cultural experience was very isolation and painful". This is still very much the case today. Every time I walk back from the E-Quad and see eating club members enjoying themselves on their front lawns, I am reminded that people like me will never really belong here.|~|3|~|Thursday, April 3, 2014 4:16 PM|~|1317302635|~|1316778075|~|0

Every action I take is weighted with the conscience that I must protect myself from the possible threat of the man on the train looking me up and down, the stranger walking behind me at night, the intoxicated friend who's coming on too strong. Your "concern" for the women of this campus is, frankly, misguided, especially if your idea of "exercising individual precaution" involves dictating to me exactly what I should wear to not get raped. Women have already received enough implicit and explicit instruction on how to avoid sexual assault. We possess common sense and a desire for self-preservation, which should be enough. We're not going to forget to protect ourselves. Our clothes, bodies, and BACs are never an invitation for sexual assault. I suggest you reevaluate your position.|~|20|~|Sunday, March 30, 2014 11:24 PM|~|1311348992|~|NA|~|1
60292|~|Concerned Third Party|~|Emmy, I don't think that Zach and Sergio are arguing that "clothes, bodies, and BACs" are an invitation for sexual assault. I think their position on the most important issue - the fact that the perpetrators are ultimately the ones responsible for the act - is the same as yours and the rest of the board's. Where they differ is in saying that, as unfortunate as it is, women who are scantily clad and/or very drunk ARE more susceptible to the occasional men who wish to do them harm. Their lack of clothing coverage, like it or not, makes them more of a target, and their inebriation, like it or not, makes them less able to physically defend themselves and/or take measures to involve nearby friends. I don't like the fact that this is the case. But it is. We don't live in an ideal world, and we never will. And a responsible way of dealing with this reality is to understand it and take whatever measures YOU deem appropriate to protect yourself. Nobody's "dictating to you exactly what you should wear not to get raped". All they're saying is be careful and use your best judgment.|~|14|~|Monday, March 31, 2014 12:34 AM|~|1311392839|~|1311348992|~|0

There needs to be a renewed focus on preventing sexual assault by targeting those who commit sexual assault. If people continue to insist that sexual assault exists (even in part) because of women's failure to exercise proper judgment, we're perpetuating the problem and shifting the blame from those who actually commit those crimes.|~|13|~|Monday, March 31, 2014 12:43 AM|~|1311398075|~|1311392839|~|1
60292|~|Concerned Third Party|~|Personally, I'm of the opinion that there's no such thing as too much education and training on how to protect oneself from rape, or any other kind of violent assault for that matter. As long as the threat exists, any preparation you do to counter it is time well spent, and may just save your life or the life of someone you care about in the future. As for targeting perpetrators of sexual assault, I agree with you. There should be a zero tolerance policy, because of the numerous studies demonstrating the "serial" phenomenon of most sex-related offenses. Others may debate that, I'm certainly not. I think the important distinction here is this: sexual assault does not EXIST because of the choices women make in clothing, alcohol consumption, and the like. Anyone who says it does is out of touch with reality. Sexual assault exists because there are mentally ill men (and women, albeit less frequently) out there who perpetrate it. HOWEVER, the INCIDENCE of sexual assault can be lessened by women making smarter choices so they are tougher targets for these predators. I think any education and attention devoted to that fact is useful, and should go hand in hand with tougher prosecution of sexual offenses. I don't think the two are mutually exclusive, and if anything the extra attention and education reduces the scope of the problem rather than perpetuating it.|~|9|~|Monday, March 31, 2014 12:55 AM|~|1311403764|~|1311398075|~|0

It is diverting attention and culpability from perpetrators of a heinous crime (U.S. legal definition, not mine) to the survivors of it, much like teaching your young daughter to fear strangers and act as a sexual gate-keeper places responsibility on her if someone else hurts her while  teaching your son to "get the girl", hit a sexual "homerun", and to disregard the others' needs in their quest to prove their masculinity by "being No. 1" frees him from any culpability. It's victim-blaming: irrational, cruel, self-perpetrating, and sociopathic in its complete lack of empathy for people who have suffered something that will scar them until they die. If you bothered to read any of the literature on this, you would understand that a survivors' dress or behavior had no bearing on their being targeted: rapists will go for people they think are vulnerable to them, less likely to report them, and who trust them enough to be too confused and horrified to react properly once the assault is under way, usually by establishing some kind of relationship beforehand. This thinking is also based on the premise that they are somehow more entitled to get what they want than the other person is to personhood and bodily autonomy. The true barometer of sexual assault frequency is how much gender equality and general respect for others is part of a given culture. Rape is more frequent in cultures that place women as second-class citizens; many of them also place stringent dress codes on women so that no skin shows, no bodily shape is detectable, etc.- and yet the abuse persists. It's not what survivors are doing, it's what criminals are doing. When I myself was assaulted at Princeton, I was wearing un-ripped jeans and a crew-neck t-shirt.  I was stone-cold sober in the middle of a Saturday afternoon (I actually don't drink, never could like the taste). I had just returned to campus from fellowshipping at my church. And I decided to meet up with a friend whom I had known for a year and with whom I had spent time safely before. How was I supposed to know he had decided to force sex on me that day? How dare you tell me I had not taken enough precautions? How dare you tell me I did not use common sense? How dare you create a world in which my sister and mother felt justified in blaming me for what happened, because I had not vetted my "friend" enough to be safe? And how dare you create a home environment (because the vast majority of undergraduate Princetonians live on campus) in which it is acceptable for P-safe to tell me not to report my assault (and dorm-room break-in, by the way) to the police and for the residential college disciplinary system to decide that the assault "may or may not have happened" and that they would take no measures to address my "assault"? How dare you speak of something you know nothing about? How dare you?|~|17|~|Monday, March 31, 2014 3:36 PM|~|1312228927|~|NA|~|0

Maybe Zach and Sergio would like to share their theories about how my "immodest dress" and sobriety contributed to my assault. Then again, that would require pulling their heads out of their butts, and I get the sense that they enjoy keeping them there.|~|12|~|Tuesday, April 1, 2014 1:12 AM|~|1312855312|~|NA|~|0

60292|~|SSarra '16|~|A crime (both legal and moral) is a crime, and to say "it is simply common sense that the inebriation and immodest dress renders a woman more susceptible to sexual crime" is pure, unadulterated victim blaming, plain and simple. It would be illogical to say that "it is simply common sense that leaving one's car on the street renders the owner of the car more susceptible to robbery"- we all know the fault lies squarely with the perpetrator of the crime. I agree with Zach and Sergio, individual prudence and agency are important- ESPECIALLY the individual prudence of agency of criminal rapists and those who commit sexual assaults. We have criminal statutes (and social morality) because people should be free to live their lives, in both public and private spaces, free of harm- physical, psychological, monetary, or otherwise- while going about their lives in those spaces. Further, I find the attempt to wrap this argument in the veil of common sense, responding to the "practical ramifications" of life in a world in which men are predators, especially repugnant because the dissent reeks of a particular kind of cold-hearted, "Christian" moral judgement. The smoking gun? "Immodest dress." The women of Princeton dress themselves like whores, and thus invite upon themselves "sexual crime at the hands of morally depraved men." If only they didn't dress themselves in short semi dresses, or short-shorts and cleavage revealing tees, or nice Saturday night skirts and heels, then they wouldn't have this problem! "We do not condone an uncompassionate, victim-incriminating community." Except, you do. Saying you don't doesn't excuse the argument of your dissent.|~|7|~|Monday, March 31, 2014 6:55 PM|~|1312498097|~|NA|~|1

She stated, at first, that she turned down a full merit scholarship to Vanderbilt to attend Duke.  Her original "anonymous" article led to vast publicity and now her own "brand."

60287|~|anon|~|Princeton is one of the best schools out there for financial aid. It's actually cheaper for me to go here than to go to my local state school. Of course for some families it's never going to be enough and you still might have to make some sacrifices, but in the end my parents are so thankful for what Princeton gives us in comparison to my sisters' schools. Making Princeton affordable is one of the easiest issues for Princeton to address and this is probably why it already has. Let's focus on the more difficult issues that drive low-income students away, like a general atmosphere of elitism and exclusion, instead of targeting Princeton's financial aid on ungrounded assumptions based on a single student's story at an entirely different school.|~|4|~|Monday, March 31, 2014 2:59 AM|~|1311479362|~|NA|~|0
60287|~|hmm|~|As another Marylander, UMCP was also $15-20k per year cheaper for me. I'm here now, but don't assume Princeton's financial aid works the same for everyone. We're good, but we could do better, in theory. That being said, Princeton *was* the most generous private school I applied to, and I will be forever grateful for that. Princeton does a great job relatively speaking, and it's really quite amazing.|~|3|~|Monday, March 31, 2014 7:47 PM|~|1312558972|~|1311479362|~|0
60287|~|Same Here|~|Totally agreed with "hmm" above. I'm from probably the same suburb as Morse (or one nearby). We may have even gone to the same school. Princeton has blow-your-socks-off aid for *low-income* students. That's not the same thing is middle income, and middle income families still have financial needs. Sometimes a student's tuition can't be their parent's first priority when life has other needs. Princeton was also the most generous private school that I applied to and I appreciate what they have given me, but a lot of people still slip through the cracks and graduate with debt. Can't fault the Duke young woman for wanting to graduate without debt, IMO.|~|2|~|Wednesday, April 2, 2014 9:29 AM|~|1314819500|~|1312558972|~|0
60287|~|Partially agreed|~|Princeton offered the cheapest tuition of any of the top schools I got in to, so good for them. However, there was still a $30K+ difference between Princeton and UMCP (I'm another Marylander). In retrospect, I wish I had stayed in state. That said, the atmosphere of elitism was not something I really knew about before coming here. I hate that it exists, and it's a factor in my regret, but it didn't affect my decision on which school to attend.|~|2|~|Monday, March 31, 2014 5:16 PM|~|1312359319|~|1311479362|~|0
60287|~|Truth|~|Belle Knox didn't "have to consider turning to pornography just for the sake of paying tuition." She turned down a full scholarship at Vanderbilt. Further, she could have just taken out loans. Like a typical modern day female though, she wants to play the victim card, even at the expense of an institution that has supported her through all her ridiculous antics. tl;dr Tuition costs in general need to come down. Belle Knox has nothing to do with that.|~|3|~|Monday, March 31, 2014 6:54 PM|~|1312497146|~|NA|~|0

59936|~|15|~|It's also really vital that people think beyond the way that mental health is talked about here, even during well-intentioned events like mental health week, as the equivalent of mental strain. No, a massage isn't going to help me with my obsessive compulsive disorder. Taking advantage of free cookies at a study break isn't going to help me with my eating disorder. And getting more sleep or relaxing isn't that great of advice to tell me when I've been unable to drag myself out of bed for hours at a time. Here at Princeton, we normalize the effects of stress to the extent that it's considered to be the natural order of things. This obviously isn't healthy, and obviously programs that seek to mitigate the harmful effects of stress should happen. But when we talk about mental health a lot of the time it is in a way that ignores the fact that illnesses could pre-date Princeton or not be related to work-related stresses, and that assumes that the solutions are simple. The tone of the current conversation acts as though we all experience our minds and our stress here in the same way, and flattens the way in which factors like class, race, sexuality, gender/gender identity, and others make some of our lives challenging in ways that aren't addressed in the mainstream conversations.|~|6|~|Wednesday, March 26, 2014 11:45 PM|~|1305075756|~|NA|~|1

The correct analogy would be two cars driving together and one purposely slamming into the other, or a car seeing the pedestrian and running over them intentionally, even when the pedestrian looked both ways. It doesn't matter if the pedestrian looked both ways, because the car is searching for a pedestrian to hit much like rapists seek out victims.

I'm not the responsible party in the event of an accident. If a car hits me, they get a ticket, they get sued, etc. If the car kills me, they're charged with vehicular homicide and they go to jail. Just like someone who takes advantage of a woman like that is charged with rape and they go to jail... Not only is her analogy comparing apples to oranges, it doesn't even make sense even if you accept the comparison. How the hell did this woman graduate from Princeton? Hell, I wonder how this woman graduated from any college at all.|~|7|~|Wednesday, March 26, 2014 2:02 AM|~|1303191712|~|1303046346|~|0
59701|~|Prevention > Legislation|~|"If a car hits me, they get a ticket, they get sued, etc. If the car kills me, they're charged with vehicular homicide and they go to jail." That's not a reason to not pay attention to other drivers.  Just because the other driver got punished doesn't mean you didn't get hurt or killed. Yes, rapists get punished.  That doesn't mean you should just put yourself out in risky situations thinking that retroactive punishment will make you invulnerable.  I would rather not be raped at all than punish someone after they already raped me.  And considering that rape isn't an accident, I'd say it's more akin to a hit-and-run than an accident, in which case you damn well better be looking both ways before you cross the street. And I do look both ways before crossing the street because I would rather make sure that I won't get hit than just hope the drivers have my best intentions.|~|8|~|Wednesday, March 26, 2014 2:31 AM|~|1303205802|~|1303191712|~|0

It does not excuse someone taking advantage of her. I have two adult sons. Both were taught that if she drinks, she is OFF LIMITS. She is not asking for it because she is wearing a mini skirt or tight top. Treat sex like a contract. Yes is the only answer that means yes. Not maybe or I don't know or meh. Only YES. Shoot, if I were a man out there dating, I'd make them sign a contract. . ;)|~|8|~|Wednesday, March 26, 2014 12:48 PM|~|1303788326|~|1303769559|~|0

59701|~|Mart|~|Why should a victim bear responsibility when a monster decides to violate them?  People drink all the time, in their own houses and in bars across the world.  Most of them will be perfectly fine.  It is only when a predator decides to make a conscious choice of assaulting someone that a crime occurs.  We need to put the focus on the perpetrators, not the victims.  Also, many victims of assault are underage or assaulted by someone they know and trust.  Making blaming statements only adds to the difficulty they face in reaching out for help.  Women (and men, and children) can be assaulted in any situation, inside or outside the house, inebriated or not.  We should not have to adjust our freedoms because society doesn't put the blame on the perpetrator.|~|3|~|Wednesday, March 26, 2014 6:36 PM|~|1304374255|~|1304020595|~|1

While I would never insinuate that a woman's behavior serves as an excuse for rape, I don't think that anyone should be able to prosecute her alleged attacker was intoxicated as well, so long as there wasn't a protest. What you're insinuating in your post is that anyone should be able to get act now and regret later, something I don't agree with. Also, although a rape should never take place in the first place, it is a reality that we live with. I don't think it's unfair to say that women in 2014, who are fully aware of the dangers of going places alone or getting inebriated beyond comprehension, should pay mind to their behaviors. This is not to say drinking or dressing provocative is in invitation. It's just stating that because rape is a common reality in our culture, protective measures should be taken. We are aware of the dangers that surround us, and while many attacks could not have been prevented, there are some that could have been.|~|3|~|Wednesday, March 26, 2014 7:56 PM|~|1304578011|~|1304506114|~|1

Its just a fact that if you act irresponsibly (i.e., getting inebriated in a social setting) you are more likely to meet with dire consequences.  Is this fair? No....but life is not fair.  I think the take-home point is that when you act responsibly and take personal precautions, you are less likely to meet with negative outcomes.

59083|~|sigh|~|Intellectual dishonesty Alert. I know that you did not write this entire article not knowing that: 1) an independent study conducted by the Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute, which found that while the Keystone XL would result in 2,500 to 4,650 TEMPORARY construction jobs, this impact will be reduced by higher oil prices in the Midwest, which will likely reduce national employment. The Cornell researchers asserted that "The construction of KXL will create far fewer jobs in the U.S. than its proponents have claimed and may actually destroy more jobs than it generates". 2) Keystone will NOT improve our energy independence - the independent study conducted by the Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute refers to some studies (e.g. a 2011 study by Danielle Droitsch of Pembina Institute) according to which "a good portion of the oil that will gush down the KXL will probably end up being finally consumed beyond the territorial United States". It also states that the project will increase the heavy crude oil price in the Midwestern United States by diverting oil sands oil from the Midwest refineries to the Gulf Coast and export markets. The fact that you are deliberately ignoring evidence contrary to your position doesn't make your argument stronger; it makes yours argument intellectually dishonest. It makes your argument misinformation. I'm just confused why you decided to pose this as a simple, straightforward issue when it very clearly isn't. Do you really think the internet NEEDS another person pretending that the problems that our nation faces are simple? For that reason alone, I think you should feel bad about writing this article. I  just wish that I could wake up one morning to writing by a Princetonian that's unique, isn't poorly argued or factually mistaken. But even when it's something I agree with, the reasoning is always all too holey.|~|9|~|Wednesday, March 12, 2014 12:25 AM|~|1280979898|~|NA|~|0

That in itself is problematic, but a different problem. I don't know enough about the issue to say whether we can trust the State Department report, but it seems like it embraces Keystone. He's just being a tedious and unimaginative writer (it's the Prince, to be expected), not a dishonest one.

When someone begins the article with only a scant few details about the KXL protests and then proceeds to accuse the students of "promoting a false premise," I'd argue he owes it to those students to make a intentional (and yes, deliberate) effort to understand their concerns and research their claims before writing an article like this. That is, DH was presented with the facts at one point and therefore had to make a decision, intentionally or unintentionally, whether he was going to put any effort into researching a point of view other than his own. He decided against it, preferring to only discuss arguments that supported his preconceived notions on the matter. And BECAUSE he suggested that the student protesters were spreading misinformation under a false premise, I'd assert that he needs to make sure he's not 'accidentally' ignoring evidence contrary to his own claims and spreading misinformation of his own.

59083|~|Please...|~|...get your facts right: 1) That number of 42,000 jobs is grossly inflated. In reality, only about 3,900 temporary jobs over the course of one year will be created, and only 35 permanent jobs will remain after construction is completed. (and for what it's worth, couldn't these highly-coveted jobs also be found in the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure in the US?) 2) It isn't automatically guaranteed that we'll have sole claim to the oil that comes through the pipeline just because it travels across our country. They're still gonna sell it to the highest bidder, whether that's us or other overseas markets. Plus, investing in this would only perpetuate America's dependency on oil. We aren't energy independent yet, and building the pipeline won't help us. Brigadier General Anderson has pointed out, "Canadian oil won’t replace imports from hostile countries because Texas refiners are serving global demand rather than domestic need." 3) It's not safe. Not at all. The safety and spill response standards for the pipeline materials are only for conventional crude oil, but the tar sands bitumen is far more corrosive than crude oil and poses a higher risk of spills. Plus, the Keystone XL's leak detection system only detects spills that are larger than half a million gallons per day. I wouldn't want to be in the path of 400,000 gallons per day of abrasive/corrosive tar sands bitumen... 4) First, even if it WAS inevitable that the Canadian tar sands would be exploited regardless of the Keystone XL pipeline and that carbon emissions would be the same whether the US or someone else used the oil, it still wouldn't give us a moral "get-out-of-jail-free" card to be the ones responsible for those emissions. Arguing that something bad is "going to happen anyway" by no means gives us permission to be the source of the problem.  The students are not promoting the "false premise" that you suppose. The pipeline is either going to be built in the US or not in the US. They're protesting its construction in the US.  Second, "already working on developing an alternative" does NOT equal "already have an alternative set and ready to go." Enbridge's attempts to build a 730 mile pipeline to the West Coast have already been stalled because of indigenous communities along the way, for instance. I could say much, much more about a myriad of other issues I have with this article, including the claim that it's actually better for our environment's wellbeing (*gag*, I don't think even most pipeline supporters deny that it's bad for soil/water quality and overall carbon emissions), but I've said more than enough for now and will leave the rest to someone else.|~|2|~|Wednesday, March 12, 2014 1:42 AM|~|1281024420|~|NA|~|0
59083|~|Nik Hofer '17|~|The idea that a pipeline that would allow TransCanada to move 830,000 barrels of oil is completely ridiculous, regardless of what the State Department's flawed report said. Completely ignoring the obvious safety concerns, the fact of the matter is also that the Tar Sands refining process produces 17% more carbon emissions that the refining process for standard oil, and this comes at a time when our world is undeniably beginning to feel the effects of climate change. This nation is in a bad place, and building this pipeline could help provide some temporary jobs for a few years. (Although only 42 permanent jobs in the long run). But this pipeline will hurt EVERYONE, not just in this country but in this world, until we are finally strangled by our dependence on fossil fuels. So yeah, civil disobedience against a system that's so flawed that it is even considering allowing this pipeline to happen was the best course of action.|~|3|~|Wednesday, March 12, 2014 12:42 AM|~|1280990137|~|NA|~|1

59083|~|Gregory Dunkling|~|If Keystone is so safe for the environment, why not build it in Canada?  This would be a logic solution, and one I asked my relatives on a recent visit.  The answer is twofold: 1) Canadians do not want it built in their county out of environmental concerns; and 2) provincial and aboriginal financial claims on the project will harm TransCanada's profit.  The Aboriginal Council demands a 10 percent equity stake if a pipeline runs across their lands. As for the job creation claim, this is bogus and little more than a Fox News talking point.  The actual total expenditure in the US is closer to $4b not 7B (the rest occurs in Canada with no impact on jobs in the US). A Cornell study reveals that we can expect 2,500-4,650 temporary direct construction jobs for two years; while a large portion of the primary material input for KXL—steel pipe—will not even be produced in the United States (Canada and India reap these rewards). Contrast this with 2.7 million jobs already generated in the US  green economy and it begs the question: "If job creation is a primary goal, why not invest in green energy?" It is hands down a larger job generator than Keystone ever will be. We hear that Keystone will be a big shot in the arm for the American economy and this is why the Obama Administration should support this project. Again, findings of the Cornell study reveal two important often ignored realities: + KXL will divert Tar Sands oil now supplying Midwest refineries, so it can be sold at higher prices to the Gulf Coast and export markets.  As a result, consumers in the Midwest could be paying 10 to 20 cents more per gallon for gasoline and diesel fuel. These additional costs (estimated to total $2–4 billion) will suppress other spending and will therefore cost jobs. + Pipeline spills incur costs and therefore kill jobs (just ask folks in Louisiana). Clean-up operations and permanent pipeline spill damage will divert public and private funds away      from productive economic activity. In 2010 US pipeline spills and explosions killed 22 people, released over 170,000 barrels of petroleum into the environment, and caused $1 billion dollars worth of damage in the United States. Finally, people argue, "well this oil will be used anyways, so why not create economic benefit foe the US.  I suppose with the difficulty in getting the pipeline built anywhere, the best answer is: "Well maybe."  We can't be too sure since Canadians apparently don't want it in their country, and many Americans are likewise opposed. Just as nuclear power appeared to be the solution to dependence on oil, we can see how challenges with this energy technology has prevented it from ever materializing as the logical alternative. The distortions about Keystone might be viewed as part of the the huge gamble some are placing on building a pipeline across a large section of the US to make oil available to export markets, including China. Is it worth it to fuel China with their ever growing need for oil? Cast in this light, we'll see how ranchers, farmers, Native Americans and the general American public feel about risking their land and water supply for this cause.|~|0|~|Monday, April 28, 2014 4:24 PM|~|1359549532|~|NA|~|1

For many people (those who can't get their record expunged/whatever) a conviction is a life sentence. It can keep you from education or employment long after the conclusion of the actual sentence and parole. By removing the question from undergrad applications, the University would make a statement: that when your sentence is over, it's over.* It's extremely difficult for the University to end discriminatory practices in policing and sentencing. It's extremely easy to remove the question from University applications.

58910|~|Voice of Reason|~|I'm sorry, but this sad attempt at a refutation of George's argument presented in "What Is Marriage" makes us seriously question whether David Will even read the work. I'll demonstrate how Will's refutation fails in both two dimensions: the philosophical, deductive reasoning dimension, and the socially pragmatic dimension. Will's Claim: "George presumably holds this view because he wishes to foster a society in which the couples who marry also become excellent parents." Response: No, David Will. George holds the view that "The biological capacity to reproduce is the higher good that makes heterosexual, monogamous marriage a unique and vital institution" because (1) it is the decisive factor that gives rise to a view of marriage that is philosophically tenable, establishing a basis for marriage that gives it the norms and contours of permanence, exclusivity, and monogamy and  (2) it gives rise to norms of social conduct that promote the common good, including men and women committing to one another and maximizing the likelihood that a child has parents to care for it, thereby increasing the probability that a child becomes a productive citizen instead of a government funded charity case. Regarding (1): Let's deal with (1) first. Under the conjugal view of marriage, it makes sense that it should be a permanent, sexual exclusive, and monogamous institution. To precisely spell out all the reasons why would be to reiterate the majority of "What is Marriage." Rather than copying and pasting that, you can read it here:  http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/pa... If you do not agree with their definition of marriage, which by definition is only possible between a man and a woman, then please answer this question: What is marriage, why should it have the norms and contours it does, and why should the government regulate it? Unless and until you do so you have no grounds to criticize their view on philosophical terms, because you have not put forth a definition of marriage that would entail the norms and contours of permanence, monogamy, and sexual exclusivity (that you take for granted) and that would simultaneously be consistent with gay people marrying. Regarding (2): Will's claim: "George presumably holds this view because he wishes to foster a society in which the couples who marry also become excellent parents." Response: The main social benefit that the three co-authors of the work cite is that the conjugal view increases the likelihood that a child will be born and raised by its biological mother and father, which all the empirical and statistical evidence shows brings the best outcomes for children. The social science data suggests that children have the best outcomes when reared by biological mother and father, that mothers and fathers interact with children in distinct and complementary ways, and even health factors such as premature onset of puberty in girls when not raised by biological fathers are even present WHEN IT WAS UNKNOWN to the family that the father was not the biological father. All the data suggests that the biological mother and father arrangement offers the best outcomes for children. At the same time, all of the social science data suggests that children reared by same-sex couples have inferior outcomes. Now before you rush to condemn the previous sentence, saying "THERE'S NO CONTROL GROUP. WHAT IF THE MAIN FACTOR IN SUCCESSFUL REARING IS TWO PEOPLE OF ANY GENDER BEING IN A COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP IN WHICH THEY RAISE THEIR CHILDREN TO ADULTHOOD IN A STABLE HOME" read the following below, because I address this. Conclusion: So David Will, you present us with the following proposal: *Let's redefine marriage as [insert your philosophically indefensible definition of marriage here] so that same-sex people can marry. Even though all the social science data suggests that children do best when reared by their biological mother and father, there hasn't been a control group of committed same-sex mothers and fathers to measure whether or not they will rear children who have outcomes that are just as good, or possibly better than those of heterosexual couples. So let's remove the logical underpinning of marriage, and make the norms of permanence, exclusivity, and monogamy totally ad-hoc (like we did for the first of these norms in the 1960s when we created no-fault divorce, redefining marriage as no longer a permanent institution and creating a social breakdown of the nuclear family and increasing crime etc...) so that fewer heterosexual couples commit to each other, thereby creating millions of children without biological mother and father, so that gay families, which constitute less than 1% of US households (2000 U.S. Census Bureau) can get a chance to raise kids, which all the data suggests they will fail miserably at, but just in case that actually for some reason they rear them just as well, against all odds, and further, against all odds, commit to each other to raise the children to adulthood (even though we're going to redefine marriage so that commitment makes no logical sense, since it's about "how long the love lasts" and marriage is about adult concerns, not the needs of children etc..., and the fact that gay people have many times more average partners than heterosexual people), and further, against all odds (and here's the most important point), the number of children that are now, and will be, born out of wedlock as mothers and fathers further cease to commit to one another will be smaller than the number of amazing gay parents that will be there to parent these children." And you wonder why we scratch our heads. You see, even if we grant that gay parents can be just as good as heterosexual ones (heck, even if we grant that 100% of same-sex couples are just as good), provided the same opportunities, it wouldn't be the socially pragmatic thing to do to redefine marriage to break down the logical underpinning of the norms of permanence, exclusivity, and monogamy so that gay marriage is allowed. ALL OF THE DATA SUGGESTS THIS. So you present us with essentially a religious belief that an unlikely outcome will happen even though there's no empirical support to suggest it will, and you expect us to craft policy around this religious belief. I'm sorry but your refutation fails. PS. How you would refute this refutation? Present a definition of marriage that gives rise to the norms and contours of permanence, exclusivity, and monogamy and that simultaneously doesn't preclude same-sex marriage. If you do that, then your position will stand. But unless and until you do, the conjugal view is the more tenable position.|~|5|~|Monday, March 10, 2014 2:44 AM|~|1278302708|~|NA|~|1
58910|~|westburke|~|This is sophistry. Civil marriage is whatever we collectively define it to be.  It is a legal status. Competent childrearing is more important than the biological relationship between the child and parents.  This has been empirically demonstrated. In fact, children raised in same sex households do not have inferior outcomes.  This has been empirically demonstrated as well. You seem to imply that same sex couples are not based on "permanence, exclusivity, and monogamy".  Bunk.|~|6|~|Monday, March 10, 2014 10:21 AM|~|1278622172|~|1278302708|~|1
58910|~|Voice of Reason|~|Your claim: "In fact, children raised in same sex households do not have inferior outcomes. This has been empirically demonstrated as well." Response: No, my friend. This has not been empirically established and it seems like you must not have read David Will's article because he agrees this hasn't been empirically established. There is not enough statistical data on children raised by same-sex parents to do a study with random sampling, and thus no strong conclusions can be drawn in favor or against the proposition that "Gay parents in stable homes will raise children as well as children reared by their original mother and father." All of the social science data suggests that children do best when reared by their biological mother and father, and social science has also documented health issues that arise when a children is not reared by biological mother and father even when the lack of biological connection was unknown to the family. So you have to put forth a religious argument of the kind: "I believe gay parents, in spite of all the data to the contrary, would raise kids as well as kids reared by biological mother and father, and we should redefine marriage to remove it's logical underpinnings of permanence, exclusivity, and monogamy, thereby causing more heterosexual couples not to commit to each other (as happened in the 1960s when we redefined marriage so that it wasn't a permanent arrangement with no-fault divorce and wreaked social havoc and sky rocketing divorce rates). just so that less than 1% of US households can raise children together." And wonder why we say this is ridiculous. Even if 100% of gay couples raised kids as well the offset by removing the logical underpinnings of marriage, which we have data for, causes more orphans than would be saved by allowing gay couples to marry, even in this ridiculous hypothetical situation. So you can have your religious belief about everything working out after instituting such a ridiculous policy, but religion has no place in politics. If you argue that you have a definition or marriage consistent with same-sex marriage that doesn't remove the logical underpinnings of permanence, exclusivity, and monogamy, then please answer this question: What is marriage, why should it have the norms and contours it does, and why should the government regulate it?|~|3|~|Tuesday, March 11, 2014 5:34 AM|~|1279786855|~|1278622172|~|1

58910|~|Guest|~|In an age where straight couples can have children by in vitro fertilization, surrogate or adoption... and those methods are available to same-sex couples as well (and many indeed already have families)... it seems that the only underpinning that needs questioned is the motive for someone to advocate withholding civil marriage from LGBT couples. That motive is very, very likely to be based on religious beliefs and/or prejudice; lengthy arguments and rationalizations to ignore what modern marriage means, and has meant for a long time, are just the result of strong emotions against homosexuality. When the rest is cleared away, it's either ignorance or bigotry at the heart of such passionate rebuke against LGBT civil marriage. It does not change the facts or necessities of procreation to expand the scope of civil marriage to include such couples.|~|6|~|Monday, March 10, 2014 2:48 AM|~|1278304676|~|1278302708|~|0

58910|~|Guest|~|Marriage is a bond between two adults that is meant to keep families together and provide stability for raising children (if there are any), at the very least until the children are grown to adulthood. It is also a commitment between the two adults that is meant to last a lifetime, even if that commitment doesn't last forever. Procreation is not the primary aim of civil marriage (nor _necessary_); civil marriage is an institution meant to keep procreation from leading to orphans when it does occur. Civil marriage is all about family stability, and to that end there are many rights and benefits of civil marriage (these rights are afforded to any married couple, even if they don't have children). LGBT couples getting civil marriages and having children by a number of means, including adoption, can only be a positive to the institution of civil marriage, and a huge positive for all of the homeless orphans left behind that they will adopt in the future. Preventing them from marrying just means that many more children will not have stable families; that includes current and future orphans as well as the children of already-established LGBT families. Those families, when they do occur, will not be protected... and for what super important reasons would we leave these children and their parents without the same protections? What ungodly purpose do you serve in trying to convince people that these children and their parents don't deserve the stability and protection afforded to other families? They may be unconventional, but they serve the purpose of civil marriage. I think you're just prejudiced. If you don't reply with something better than a false equivalency biological argument, I will take it as read that you are indeed prejudiced, and will have nothing more to say to you.|~|4|~|Monday, March 10, 2014 2:55 AM|~|1278307996|~|1278306761|~|0
58910|~|Voice of Reason|~|Thanks for the reply! I'll now demonstrate why this view fails. You claim: "Marriage is an institution meant to keep procreation from leading to orphans." Response: If that's the reason the government should regulate marriage, then we'll agree that if redefining marriage results in procreation leading to more, not fewer, orphans, then redefining marriage as you have is a bad thing. As spelled out in my first lengthy response, removing the logical underpinning of being a permanent commitment results in more, not fewer orphans. I won't restate the logical and empirical support I gave in that response here, you can just scroll up and read it there. The line of reasoning and evidence I presented about also refutes your last paragraph. Concluding remarks: In addition, wouldn't you agree that if marriage is "an institution meant to keep procreation from leading to orphans" then an even better institution is one that "not only keeps procreation from leading to orphans, but also makes it the most likely that all children grow up to productive citizens"? I think we'd all agree to that, and coincidentally, that's exactly the social function that the co-authors of "What is marriage" argue their construction of marriage serves.

58910|~|Guest|~|You really are a fool. LGBT couples can't have children "by accident". If anything, they would be more responsible in their procreation than heterosexual couples because they _choose_ to be parents, meaning they will not only fail in most cases to produce orphans, but will also in many instances adopt orphans and reduce the population of homeless and parent-less children. There's a net positive in any case. I'm just done talking to you, after your failure at reason and seeing the situation with any amount of clarity and empathy for LGBT couples and their families. It's clear you don't care about reality, you just want to try to rationalize a refusal to provide the familial recognition, protections and benefits of civil marriage to "gays". In the end, you simply don't care enough about others, and you care too much about your prejudices. Besides, no federal courts, much less the Supreme Court, are going to buy your argument. It has the same kind of weight that Young Earth Creationist arguments have; rational people see though them easily, and all you have is repeating false information and stereotypes about gay people over and over. People are seeing more clearly, and the courts are deciding more easily that there are no rational reasons that pass scrutiny.|~|4|~|Monday, March 10, 2014 3:10 AM|~|1278314407|~|1278313545|~|0
58910|~|Voice of Reason|~|You claim: "if anything, they would be more responsible in their procreation than heterosexual couples" Response: Once again, it wouldn't matter "if anything, they would be more responsible in their procreation than heterosexual couples" because the number of orphans saved and productive citizens generated as a result of allowing same sex couples to marry would still be greatly outweighed by the number of children that are orphaned by heterosexual couples who do not commit to each other. That is to say, removing the logical underpinning of a permanent commitment causes more children to be orphaned than children who are saved from being orphaned by allowing same-sex marriage. Furthermore, you provide no evidence for your claim. Since these couples have so many more partners than heterosexual couples and have much more difficulty with long term relationships, I'd be inclined to think they wouldn't necessarily be as responsible. With all the partner hopping, they'd likely just create a bunch of single parents, but in this case it's even worse because they'd be creating single parents with no biological connection whatsoever to the child. Obviously I have no evidence this would be the result, but it just make the point that on the face of it, your claim is not as obvious as your tone suggest it is.|~|3|~|Monday, March 10, 2014 3:25 AM|~|1278321210|~|1278314407|~|1

Response: I agree with this, and so do the co-authors of "What is Marriage." In all 50 states, gay people can have a religious community perform a wedding ceremony for them, and this is not against the law. By contrast, polygamy is illegal in most jurisdictions, and you can go to jail for it. The worry isn't about what gay people do, it's about what happens when you redefine marriage to remove the logical underpinnings that lead to the norms and contours of permanence, exclusivity, and monogamy. All the historical and social science data we have shows that as these logical underpinnings are removed, more orphans are created. Orphans require government funding to be raised, and generally don't become productive citizens. That's why the government has an interest in a healthy marriage culture.|~|2|~|Tuesday, March 11, 2014 5:47 AM|~|1279793437|~|1279547289|~|1

Since straight couples don't have to settle for "religious marriage" status only, why should gay couples?  How are more orphans created when gay people get married? Even if that were true, why is raising children outside of the family security of marriage preferable?  What data show that when gay couples marry, somehow more orphans are created? Cite some studies. If you want fewer orphans, pass laws requiring straight people to take care of the children they product. There is no connection between gay couples getting married and straight people not taking care of their own flesh and blood. In other words, don't blame or burden gay people for the faults of straight people.

Never before have I ever heard anyone argue that it's better to raise children outside of marriage (and I'm no spring chicken!). That's a shocking public policy to be arguing in favor of. We know that's what Prof. George wants, given that he certainly isn't advocating that same-sex couples be prohibited from raising children....at least not yet he isn't. Perhaps Prof. George's argument could work within a religious framework or other sub-system of society. Under the US Constitution, the government cannot hand out important legal rights inequitably, lacking a rational public purpose. Given that both straight couples and gay couples raise children, it is awfully hard to argue that only straight couples should be allowed to marry.

If kids are not raised by their non-biological parent, the next best thing is a male and female who can give the kid the mother and father role model the child needs. And if the hetro couple is adopting, most likely they will not be too bad of parent. So the argument against same ex parenting is that every kid need a mom and a dad.

This answered will never be solved because if a same sex couple have a  kid, the kid will either be adopted or come from another person's DNA. Either way, that kid is going to ask where is my mom if it live with two same sex men or where is my dad if it lives with two same sex women. The kid will always ask where is the other half that created me. This situation will confuse the child. No child should be denied a mother or father|~|0|~|Friday, March 14, 2014 9:35 PM|~|1285315962|~|NA|~|1
58910|~|Guest|~|Hetero couples use these same methods; they use adoption, they use surrogates, and they use in vitro fertilization. So there's already many children in the world who aren't being raised by their biological parents, or who are being raised by one biological parent and one non-biological parent. Many children are being raised by a single parent, whether biological or not, and no one is making a case that children can't be raised by just one person. So two people, even of the same sex (and one of them may indeed contribute DNA), is clearly within the range of acceptable parenting solutions (on the spectrum between "single non-biological parent" and "both biological parents").|~|0|~|Friday, March 14, 2014 9:37 PM|~|1285317959|~|1285315962|~|0
58910|~|DTM2131|~|But the major key is that the kid is not denied a mother and father or a mother and father role model.  Most hetro coules have kids from each other. Hetro couples only adopt, use a surrogate or vitro fertilization as a last result, not as a first result. But, still, the kid is not denied a mother and father or a mother and father role model. I agree there are many kids who are being raised by one parent or not their biological parents. Those kids are usually what the school system  labels "at risk" kids. We don't need more "at-risk" kids. So, lets not put kids in non-optimal situations by denying them a mom and a dad or a mom and dad role model. That is why a single male or female have a hard time adopting kids, if they can adopt at all. Kids thrive the best with a mom and a dad because every kid is born from a egg and a sperm which comes from a male and a female, not two males or two females. In every situation you name above, the kid was born from a mom and a dad. So why deny them that right of having a mom and a dad or a mom and dad role model?|~|0|~|Friday, March 14, 2014 9:57 PM|~|1285333791|~|1285317959|~|1
58910|~|Guest|~|Actually you're wrong, there are hetero couples that choose adoption because there are so many orphaned children, and it's not a last result but a moral choice. Still, two parents of the same sex having children that are either half theirs (by DNA) or adopted is still better than single parents; I'd only call it "non-optimal" to be increasing the amount of single parent families... two loving adults who actually choose to have kids, as they don't have children by accident like hetero couples can, is already ahead of the game. There are many "non-optimal" hetero families that either didn't want children or who are just not good parents... go after that first, if you're not prejudiced.|~|1|~|Friday, March 14, 2014 10:03 PM|~|1285338580|~|1285333791|~|0
58910|~|DTM2131|~|Regardless of the hetro couple reason, the kid is still getting a mom and a dad. lol you are commicial if u you think two loving couples who choose to have kids is a better environment than a hetro couple who are the biological parent of the child. You act like all gay couples are good parents. You smoking something! There are bad and good hetro and gay couple. But, the difference is that the bad hetro couple can have a kid by the given right of mother nature. The government or I have no control over bad hetro couples who want to procreate. So,Take that up with mother nature! But, the government do have control over the bad hetro couple who want to adopt. You see the difference! ALL Good and bad Gay couples were not giving the right to procreate from one another by mother nature, unless they have intercourse with the opposite sex. I agree that two same sex parents are better than a single parent. But, two same sex individuals are not better parents than a male and female who are the biological parent of a kid!!|~|0|~|Friday, March 14, 2014 10:27 PM|~|1285360951|~|1285338580|~|1

58910|~|DTM2131|~|Out of that entire paragraph, is that's only logical response you could come up with? The state is not in the business of denying the child a mom and dad. If a gay wants a kid, he/she can go have a kid. The government is not stopping them from having a kid. But, the state is stopping a child from being denied a mother and father. There are evidence that show kids do better with a mom and a dad. We are talking about a human life, not a puppy. So why throw kids in a new situation before you fully study the environment? Logic will tell you that the best situation for a kid is with his/her biologicial mom and a dad because a male and a female are the only union that can create life. This is not about religion. Its about nature and life. The government is not denying same sex parenting, hell, the parents who are suing are same sex parents. The states is only saying two females can not adopt these kids, only one sex can adopt thee kids because every child has one mom and one dad. There are millions of  studies and millions of kids who says a mom and a dad is the optimal environment. What evidence do yo u have that is ten years or older that says same sex parenting is the optimal environment for a kid? |~|0|~|Friday, March 14, 2014 10:38 PM|~|1285369417|~|1285362340|~|1
58910|~|Guest|~|1) If Jane Doe can raise children by herself, whether or not she's the biological mother... 2) ...then Jane Doe and Mary Smith can raise children together, whether they're the biological parents or not. Without attacking the first situation, you have no argument against the second situation. It becomes clear that you're passing off your moral judgment and disgust about homosexuality as the rationalization that they are "non-optimal parents"... and anyone with _half_ a brain can see that your argument is pure sophistry! The single parent situation versus two same-sex parents is, in general, easy math. Two is better than one (specific instances notwithstanding). In both cases the children are going to want to know where they came from... who both of their biological parents are... and in that case it's up to the parent(s) to discuss that with them. The only one denying anything to anyone is you, by denying categorically that same-sex parents are fit to raise children. Shame on you; shame, shame, shame. You're prejudiced and can't even admit it. That's the only thing that makes sense; I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt that you're not somehow of low intelligence and unable to see reason.|~|2|~|Saturday, March 15, 2014 1:57 AM|~|1285489453|~|1285369417|~|0

58910|~|Honest Question|~|I saw someone in the comments below refer to LGBT couples getting marriages, and seeing the "B" part of the acronym included made me wonder - do bisexual people actually want to get married? Isn't part of a bisexual person's identity the fact that they like it with members of both genders? So in order for people who identify this way to get married, they would have to make a choice, one way or the other, for the sake of the monogamy aspect of marriage. But then wouldn't they be either straight or gay/lesbian? They wouldn't be able to live out their identity, in that case... or at least, how I understand it. Please excuse my general ignorance on this subject. I'm just genuinely trying to learn more and would be grateful if someone could enlighten me.|~|0|~|Monday, March 10, 2014 10:39 PM|~|1279562860|~|NA|~|0
58910|~|Guest|~|Just because we men are attracted to every hot woman we see doesn't mean we can't make a choice to settle down with one of them. The pool for bisexual people is larger, but they would be making the same choice we all do: choose one person to commit to, either for love or some other reason that's important to them. I'm not sure "identity" is really the question; they're still attracted to people from both sexes no matter who they ultimately end up with, and we have to remember that the LGBT spectrum really is that; a spectrum. It's not off/on, 50/50, perfectly divided. Someone being "bi" doesn't necessarily mean they're equally attracted to both sexes; it's not that black-and-white these days, there are many variations of human sexual attraction.|~|4|~|Monday, March 10, 2014 10:51 PM|~|1279573637|~|1279562860|~|0

However, I would not want a convicted thief, murderer, rapist, molester, etc. living in the dorms at Princeton with me and i'm sure future Princetonians would not appreciate this either.

You're entitled to your opinion that these people aren't worthy of consideration for admission on the grounds of whatever rule violation landed them in jail, but don't accuse them of lack of personal responsibility. When someone serves a sentence in our justice system, they've taken responsibility for their actions and done their time. If you want each and every one of them to walk around with a scarlet letter until the end of his or her life, that's fine. But in a country where thousands of people are currently serving life sentences for non-violent crimes, it's ignorant to presume that someone who has been through the criminal justice system has not already been made to take responsibility and pay off their debt to society many times over.|~|17|~|Friday, March 7, 2014 4:41 PM|~|1275717261|~|1275537513|~|0

At the same time, I'm confused as to what else you want the University to do. After college admissions, I was personally ecstatic at all that Princeton would pay for; in fact, it was the only college I could actually afford without massive loans. Outside of what they already cover based on income, are you saying they should cover more? (Maybe I just didn't read the article close enough, sorry.) Because there are always things we are going to have to go without due to expense; that's just how life works. (Thankfully, education is not one of those things!) I make choices about what extracurriculars to do, how much to eat out, what meal option to choose, etc. based on what my family can afford.

58735|~|QuestScholar|~|I agree with everything you've said, but it is hard to think of a solution. The source of many problems for low-income students is the fact that the vast majority of their friends are much better off than they are, and it's not like we can or should do anything about that. Campus culture, however, can definitely be changed. For one, I've noticed that in some circles, it's accepted and even expected to complain about how expensive things are, or how we can't afford things. In paying for things like intersession trips, for example, I've commonly heard people asking for financial aid because they "don't want to ask their parents for more money since they already asked for money to go on fall/winter break trips." It's hard for me to hear this and be sympathetic, given that I don't and can't ask my parents for any money, and that I always feel guilty when I have to approach a group for financial aid. For me it's a matter of pride to pay for the trips I go on. It's a matter of pride for me to work and to make sacrifices so I can participate in a service trip, or buy a sweater, or donate money. If I want to go on some fun intersession trip, then I believe I should work to be able to pay for that trip, after all, if it is something worth doing, then it is something worth making some sacrifices for. This goes especially for service trips, since I know that there are people who have it even rougher than I do, and I'd rather the money go to people who really really need it. I need it, but I can get by without it. There are some people, however, who literally can't pay for things. I guess what I'm railing against is the sense of entitlement many Princeton students have, the sense of entitlement that justifies a student--who can clearly afford to pay--asking for financial aid, when I, can't really afford to pay, feel guilty asking for any.|~|2|~|Tuesday, March 11, 2014 1:30 PM|~|1280241660|~|NA|~|0

Princeton's fantastic financial aid makes it one of the most affordable colleges in the country. Many low-income students are attending colleges that cost just as much on paper as Princeton but which do not provide generous financial aid. They are taking out massive loans that they may never be able to repay because their school is not equally prestigious. Although we should consider the serious social divide at Princeton, we need to also keep in mind the circumstances of the less fortunate.

58591|~|Somebody has to say it...|~|The gender norms that have been long established weren't created in some vacuum. Every instance of distinction is not discrimination. Consider for example what it would take for a man to be a victim of sexual assault on the part of a woman: 1) She has to somehow be able to overpower him (males are on average much stronger than women) 2) He has to not want it (he's borderline homosexual or she is butt ugly) 3) She not only has to be able to overpower him, but he has to be in a situation in which he can't get away, so she'd have to be able to out run him or have some sort of a dangerous weapon on her The absurdity of the situation is compounded when you factor in that a man who a woman is likely to have a desire to be sexually intimate with would have none of the qualities of the above man. How many women are dying to have sex with weak, slow, borderline homo dudes? Conversely, men want sex all the time and generally any women will do and generally men are much stronger than women. That's the reason the lock system works the way it does. Whether there are other reasons for being against the locks is a separate issue. But people please stop acting like traditional norms spring out of some crazy psychopathic vacuum of pure bigotry and inanity. This generation needs to get the message. Distinction is not always discrimination. Repeat that spit.|~|5|~|Friday, March 7, 2014 7:06 AM|~|1274885457|~|NA|~|0

58591|~|Somebody has to say it...|~|Male on male rape is a separate issue. My point is that the gender distictions we make about men and women are based on reasoning about their different attributes that gives rise to the different bathroom policies for each. Look up the stats for male on male rape. More men are raped each year by other men in prison than women are raped by men. But apart from a prison setting a man is highly, highly unlikely to be raped. This means we should craft policy that protects men from prison rape, and maintain the rational principle about constructing policies that protect against likely negative outcomes. We can't micro manage the unlikely outcomes because that is tantamount to living in a police state.|~|3|~|Saturday, March 8, 2014 5:12 AM|~|1276279527|~|1275983923|~|0

Response: ^^ Yes I am saying exactly that. And simultaneously, if you switch genders then the statement ceases to be true. This looks like a contradiction? Not when you examine the facts. All studies done on the subject show that men want sex much more often than women do. The most widely cited study was the research done by Clark and Hatfield in 1989. When males and females were propositioned for casual sex with a stranger, 75% men agreed to it. Guess how many women did? 10? 5? 1? Wrong. 0% of women assented to it. There are numerous other studies that confirm this reality, check out:  http://www.carlsonmba.umn.edu/... Conclusion: A heterosexual man wants sex constantly, and most any woman will do. The same is not true for women. This justifies my premise 2. It's not rhetoric bruh|~|2|~|Monday, March 10, 2014 12:53 AM|~|1278253686|~|1278165071|~|0

Oh the times! Oh the customs! How long, O Isabella, are these columns of yours still to mock us? You ought, O Isabella, long ago to have been led out of the Prince's office by command of the editor. What? Did not that most illustrious commenter, in his capacity of a private citizen, put to shame Brendan Carroll, though for writing even slightly foolishly?

That anything may change your shoddy ideas? That you may realize that being challenged to perform your obligations as a student is a virtue? That you should consider that independent work makes Princeton students better? That you should revise the contradiction in the sentence in which you declare that "students generally choose an adviser on the basis of the professor’s research" before claiming that students do not do this? That you should consider reading the grading procedures that guide departments to grant no less than 55% of students A-range grades for their work, thus defeating one of your numerous absurd arguments? That you should ponder your propensity for abolishing traditions for no reason?

Not every thesis is original research: consider the math department where many undergrads just write an exposition of advanced research, focusing on a specific calculation. Perhaps more departments should encourage that sort of system, but I doubt it. The only reason why the math department allows undergrads to write expository theses is  because they want to have 30 majors and not 5 majors per class. Doing research in a lab doesn't require as many years of study as pure math research. Basically, if you can do research, you should do research. You are proposing to strip a vital component of the Princeton education away from it.

56551|~|Luke Paulsen|~|Interesting points. As someone who's taken a lot of BSE *and* AB classes, I would say that BSE is more demanding and work-intensive on average (especially when you factor in the extra course load). However, it's also true (as the author says) that AB work and BSE work are qualitatively different. BSE is mostly about understanding how to do something, and at the end of the day it either works or it doesn't. AB is more creative and flexible. It's often easy to skip readings and BS your way through precept, but on the other hand it's possible to do all the readings, spend hours discussing one concept, and still feel like you've only scratched the surface. So I guess AB could be less work or more work, depending on how engaged you are.|~|1|~|Thursday, February 20, 2014 10:34 AM|~|1253281373|~|NA|~|1

The grade deflation policy says that departments can give a MAXIMUM of 35% A's in any given course. And, for most entry-level classes, professors do make the curve such that the average is around a B/B+. However, it gets more complicated across majors, or "academic fields." I would like to see you explain why the average GPA of CBE majors is lower than 3.0, while your average for humanities/social science majors is significantly higher.|~|0|~|Thursday, February 20, 2014 1:36 PM|~|1253617018|~|NA|~|0

56311|~|yep|~|This.  I share a lot of the author's frustrations - and those of the authors of the arts recruiting piece - but I also recognize that the problem extends far beyond the actions of career services.  A lot of these organizations (nonprofits, arts, media) simply have (1) a much later recruiting timeline (2) much less money to spend on recruiting and (3) fewer jobs overall. I also want Career Services to do more to help Princeton students find jobs in these areas, but it is challenging when the organizations themselves have such limited resources and opportunities.  I think one of the most effective ways of helping students connect with these organizations is to have fellowship programs (like High Meadows and Project 55).  I realize these require a tremendous amount of resources, but I would love to see Princeton (or some of those wealthy alumni who went into lucrative for-profit fields)  think about investing in more fellowship-type opportunities.|~|1|~|Thursday, February 20, 2014 5:16 AM|~|1252766226|~|1252194626|~|0

Of course there are smart people outside of Princeton, but no other time in life will you be in an area with such an incredibly high density of them at once.  And no, just because a man is smart doesn't mean he'll make the best partner, but having a partner of lesser intelligence can get very tedious if you're in it for the long run.

56107|~|Mrs. R|~|I could not agree with you more. No where in her article did she say get married in college. She said start looking and stay in touch. It can take up to 5-10 yrs of dating before you find the right person. Who the hell wants to start the process at 30 or 35? These women are so freaking brainwashed. They still scream, "I want it all" even though you know you cannot have it all, but no one wants to talk about that. My mother beat the "career first" crap into my head as she went off to work (complained about it) and my brother and I were latch key kids. Fast forward 20 yrs later, she is shocked to see that my generation (30-40) are burnt out and could care less about climbing the corporate ladder with zero flexibility. We decided to create our own jobs with 100% flexibility. Most women over 35 who didn't get married, are giving up hope and talking about going to sperm banks (because the world needs more single mothers). Some ladies DO want to find a partner and have children. I am sorry if some of you think that is primitive. If the article doesn't pertain to you, then just ignore the article and go back to reading "Lean In".|~|3|~|Wednesday, February 19, 2014 3:10 PM|~|1251995971|~|1249056123|~|0

She's now going through her life and thinking of how things might have been, if only, if only, if only. If only. If only she had married a Princeton Man, how things would have been different. So she's trying to give helpful advice to people who are in her shoes, albeit 40 years later. She wants to make sure that no women at Princeton make the same mistake she did. I think she's giving this advice in good faith. But I think that we, the audience, should consider it less as advice and more like a fantasy alternate life that Patton '77 wishes she had lived instead.|~|13|~|Monday, February 17, 2014 11:25 PM|~|1249217119|~|NA|~|0

At the same time, however, it's undeniable that Patton's column only adds to the hypersexualized portrayal of men in general. I mean, maybe I'm atypical, but I haven't done anything remotely sexual in at least two weeks, enjoy monogamous relationships, and would rather date someone of my own age rather than creeping on the freshmen. And of course Patton's column demeans women who at this stage of their lives value an academic or career path more than a potential partner, but it also makes things awkward for guys and gals who genuinely want a relationship and potentially have to mistrust each other's motives.|~|4|~|Tuesday, February 18, 2014 12:18 AM|~|1249258227|~|NA|~|0

In Patton's framework getting the guy is an uphill battle in which women must either grovel for, or scale mountains in order to be chosen by god-like, golden boys. How does that schema put women in a position power to choose their partners confidently? And how does that "pedestal" not objectify and idolize men in the very same way that women have been objectified for centuries? Susan Patton's rhetoric is unfair to both sexes, plain and simple.|~|4|~|Monday, February 17, 2014 10:50 PM|~|1249177889|~|NA|~|0
56107|~|Another HYP grad|~|Lea, you can say whatever "drivel" you want, as you angrily lash out.  You will eventually graduate, then reality will set in.  No one gains from your illusion, perhaps except your wiser Princeton sisters. You will see that life and the human condition aren't as one-dimensional as you would will them to be.  Either you will circuitously find a man Patton has advised you to find while the going remains good, or you will accept an inferior outcome (assuming you are heterosexual).  You will undoubtedly like to harangue me about what is "inferior," but please humor me here. If you take the latter course, you may combatively insist you made the "right choice" all along even after the relationship settles into its long-term rhythm -- but in your quietest moments of reflection, you will know you've made a mistake.  Never fear; you wake up in the morning, and there will be other PC sisters who will assure you that your mistake was actually the best choice "for you."  It's a duplicitous form of therapy, really. Of course, you should find your "best" mate, develop yourself, etc.  Have a ball as a twenty-something.  But know that having a life partner who is mostly compatible is the foremost determinant of whether you lead the "good life" - this is just what it means to be human. Please do yourself a favor and take Patton's free advice.  Barring that, try forgetting everything she's written and I've said.  That way, you won't kick yourself any harder that you have to in your middle ages, wishing you were less blinded by sanctimony.|~|5|~|Tuesday, February 18, 2014 5:59 PM|~|1250615704|~|NA|~|0

Men find women less desirable as we age. While there might be some evidence to this fact, there are also plenty of men who would rather be with a stable and established women in her late 20s and early 30s, then a woman fresh out of college who is still finding her way in the world. Assuming the men value a woman's youth more than seemingly anything else is terribly offensive to men.|~|2|~|Monday, February 17, 2014 11:13 PM|~|1249209213|~|NA|~|0

First of all, her whining that Ms Patton is a "self-proclaimed advisor to all Princeton women" while at the same time expanding her own sphere of influence to all (wo)mankind by becoming the surrogate for "women everywhere." If that were not enough, she belies her own pomposity by either not knowing the meaning of the word "heternormative" or by applying it in a way that only serves to confuse the reader. There is so much more that could be said of this vapid read, but why bother! I hope this is not a sign that a great institution is lowering its acceptance standards.

56107|~|Dr. B. Coyle|~|Susan, I am a little older and therefore a little wiser. I graduated from college at age 21 and was married six weeks later to my childhood sweetheart - what I always wanted. We waited five and a half years to have five children, now age 28-37. We both worked, bought our first home, owned great cars, ate out at least three times a week, and travelled every year before the babies came. Then we took up camping as a family, enjoying the novelty. I told my teenage girls to marry young because "The pickens get lean."  As you mentioned, often what is available at age 30 for career women are divorcees who are really never disconnected from their first wives if children from that marriage exist and undesireables, who sucumb to the social imperative to have a spouse and often settle for the woman as much as she settles for him. But there is more. We are in some ways the people we were at 21 but also we are not in some very important ways. Infidelity erodes the trust of marriage and makes intimacy "work" instead of pleasure. Infidelity happens... not only physical infidelity but most often, emotional infidelity where instead of the spouse supplying the sounding board and advice one seeks in a partner ship, a surrogate does. It can be a co-worker, a tennis coach, a bar tender. Any addiction, controllable at age 21 is out of control at age 50, whether it is alcohol, drugs, sex, gambling or golf. We both know there are many others. When a spouse chooses the addiction over the partner, the marriage becomes just a shell of its former self yet couples stay together for social, economic and religious reasons way after the marriage is over. It is not unusual for one spouse to pursue advanced education, experience upward mobility as a result and establish a different social group with whom the less educated spouse is uncomfortable. If one spouse significantly out earns the other, resentment or a loss of respect may whittle away at the relationship. By marrying younger, women can recreate themselves post-empty nest. You must know of the large number of women who file for divorce when the last child graduates high school or college. These women can still be vital in their 50s, without resentment from a former spouse or grown children. I divorced after nearly 40 years of marriage, having experienced all the pitfalls described above and I probably cannot convince you that today, I feel as if I have it all...just not simutaneously; a challening and respected job; financial security; my health, love and affection of my children and granchildren; and a personal relationship with a male I currently repect and depend on for all the support that I would have received from my spouse in the first decades of our marriage. In addition, my former spouse and I have a very civil arrangement. My X is retired, travelling the world with many girlfriends (one at a time) who are significantly younger than I am. He claims to be very content and happy. I truley hope so because I know I am. Would I have had this timehad I waited until 35 to get married. I doubt it.|~|0|~|Monday, March 10, 2014 1:33 PM|~|1278865279|~|NA|~|0

Nominally it is illegal. De facto it is tolerated. The same situation existed for Alcohol Prohibition and legal gambling. The law was de facto tolerant when citizens ignored it, police stopped enforcement, and courts couldn't sit a jury for those charged. The parallels to today are striking. And for policy to recognize this new paradigm is not only appropriate, it is just in light of social norms. |~|0|~|Monday, February 17, 2014 4:54 PM|~|1248654922|~|1247932886|~|1

What exactly are these shared goals that can only be shared because we share a common ethnic heritage? I don't think income inequality or opening the border is a particularly Asian goal. Creating "unified identity" based on race is only useful 1. for guilting someone whose great great great granddaddy was from the same country as your great great great granddaddy into voting for your political position or 2. dividing political parties on exogenous factors|~|2|~|Monday, February 17, 2014 9:47 AM|~|1247992875|~|NA|~|0
55981|~|Linda Z|~|That's a really shallow way to view what a "unified identity" can and would do. "Identity groups" have been created to push many initiatives on the issues of education, immigration, health care, etc. They operate, not through guilt, but because as a community, the people have common needs. Asian Americans (perhaps even Latino Americans) have a unique stake in the issues listed above that would otherwise be drowned out if they individually participated in some "political party". Also, your comment seems to imply that "political parties" is the natural and organic state of America. But the association with a political party is just as artificial (or moreso) as associating with an geo-cultural identity group. Americans do not naturally fall into political parties, as evidenced by low affiliation numbers in naturalized citizens. Also, often a person's priorities cannot be perfectly captured by a "political party". Also, are you KIDDING ME that income inequality and immigration aren't a significant issues in Asian American communities.

55738|~|student2|~|I second what was said before and respectfully suggest that if signing the petition of a USG candidate is so important to you that you can quit. The public is suspicious of media outlets generally, sometimes with good reason and sometimes unjustifiably, but there is no doubt that the bias of some causes collateral damage to even the "good" papers. What I think is the main premise of your paper, that the Prince "has a responsibility to provide a well-rounded apprenticeship experience to its student journalists," is demonstrably false. The Prince's first and foremost obligation is to its readership to report the news not only fairly and accurately but also without even the appearance of bias. This is why such statements as "Schleifer is a former news editor for The Daily Princetonian" appear in articles and why news staffers are not permitted to make certain comments on Facebook and Twitter and endorse USG candidates. Imagine, as a comparison, if the New York Times were to have Paul Krugman write "objective news" articles on Republicans in Congress and also his famously opinionated, liberal-leaning editorials. He might technically have to be "objective" in his news reporting, but no one would believe it, and this lack of belief is just as important as actual bias on the part of a news staffer. Very poor decision to air what should be an internal issue publicly, especially when there are procedures in place for initiating rules changes.|~|1|~|Friday, February 14, 2014 6:43 PM|~|1244865427|~|NA|~|0
55738|~|student|~|To a newspaper, nothing is more important than it's reputation - if a newspaper appears to have even an inkling of institutional bias, it's reputation can be ruined. Think of how Fox News is viewed by liberals: nothing they say is taken seriously because it appears to have institutional bias. It's just too questionable and there are just too many potentials for crossover when a writer works for both Opinion, in which they offer opinions about campus issues, and for News, which reports objectively on those campus issues. What if Barack Obama was asked to report on the GOP National Convention? Once a person has publicly declared an opinion one way or another, they can never report objectively on that issue, and, even if they are careful, there will always be detractors who find implicit bias. The Prince doesn't want to give those detractors even more to work with. So in providing that apprenticeship experience, the Prince shouldn't necessarily work to give its writers a taste of what awaits them at Fox or at CNN or any other significantly biased news outlet. They should adopt the standard practices of respected news outlets - which includes keeping news, opinion, and copy separate - so that students know what constitutes good journalism. They should provide students with an experience that elevates the quality of journalism when students go out into the field - they should teach students how to make good press. Marcelo's article had it's own issues of appearing to be biased against the University - which is just as bad as being biased for the University - but the general idea is that being an independent student newspaper means that the Prince's reputation should be that of complete independence and objectivity. The Prince has a reputation problem, but this policy at least prevents them from exacerbating it.|~|1|~|Friday, February 14, 2014 11:46 AM|~|1244355062|~|NA|~|0

For some of this, thank Griggs vs Duke Power, which made it difficult for employers to use aptitude tests for jobs that don't really require a degree.  The other is the attitude, that, somehow a degree signifies something special.  In many cases, it does, but in others, it really does not.  I'm at the tail end of a four decade career in Information Technology, and I can say absolute reliance on a four year degree would have eliminate many of the best.  Conversely, a few of the best I've worked with or hired had degrees, even advanced ones. I found statistics the most useful of all my college courses.

Since this came at the same time as the college population was in the throes of the great GI Bill/Baby Boom expansion, it became practical and easy for employers to use a college degree rather than any apptitude or IQ testing to winnow applicant pools.  Laudable as the goal of reducing actual discrimination is, in the long-term the use of "disparate impact" approaches to what constitutes actionable racial discrimination has probably done more harm than good.

54653|~|bob gilkison|~|So true.  My parents were determined that I go to college. So, I did; for two years in which I wasted their money.  Fortunately, at that time, the USN  permitted entry into the Naval Aviation Cadet program after two years of college, so I didn't waste any more.  I accomplished my goal and followed my dream.  Oddly enough, the Navy felt that Officers had to have degrees, so the taxpayers sent me back for a degree and an MS as well.  For a long time now I have wondered whether that was wasted time and money.  I suppose that it is an advantage in some circles that I can put BA/MS after my name. Conversely, a very high percentage of Cadets, who entered flight training without degrees went on to successful careers, and many achieved Flag Rank.  Still, the Navy, in its wisdom, later decided that a degree was required to enter flight training and abolished the Cadet program.

54653|~|moobly|~|But there is no concrete standard for 'college level work'. In truth most US colleges teach an expanded high school level curriculum. For every Princeton there are several hundred minor schools that teach at a level to accommodate the students available to them. Your cautions have already come to pass. I think we need to recognize that the intellectual skills required by many skilled trades are actually above those currently required to achieve a college degree. In my experience, as an engineer, the technical knowledge and aptitude of a skilled plumber, engine mechanic, machinist, fabricator, drafter etc. is typically better than that of your average college graduate, even from related academic fields. IMO the distinction among these individuals arises primarily from their learning styles and interests. They are not less intelligent, on a psychometric basis, than your average college grad rather they approach education with a different orientation and motive. Whether Princetonians want to associate with them is irrelevant to me - I've learned to regard them as peers.|~|4|~|Monday, February 10, 2014 2:06 AM|~|1237842078|~|1237633100|~|1
54653|~|catorenasci|~|Perhaps there is no longer a concrete standard for college level work, though it used to mean (at least as recently as the early 1960s, more or less) the ability to learn a year or two's worth of calculus, to read and understand text books written at an adult level as well as to read and understand the then generally agreed upon literary and philosophical canon, and a fair command of Latin and one modern language (usually French or German).  While most (all, one would hope) Princetonians could do this even today, I would hazard a guess that at least half, if not two thirds, of today's "college" students could not.  And, rarely are such demands placed upon undergraduates today, even at elite colleges and universities. To your point that the skilled trades often required in the skilled trades are higher than those required to obtain a college degree today, I cannot disagree. (I suspect it may even be possible to graduate Princeton today without taking many particularly rigorous courses.)  That this is true does reflect an actual, not a theoretical decline  in academic rigor as another commentator pointed out. Before the Second World War, when perhaps 10-15% of the population attended college and admission was primarily a matter of preparation and means, it was certainly true that there might well be no difference in cognitive ability between a machinist or mechanic and a university trained engineer.   When more than half of the high school graduates go to college (of some sort), it is far less often (though not never) the case that the skilled tradesman has the same cognitive ability as the graduate of an elite college or university.  Sad, in a way, because many think the skilled and inventive tradesmen contributed far more to the building of our economy and national infrastructure than did the college graduates.  Yet, not sad in another way, because far fewer young men and women of real talent are unable to obtain a good college or university degree (but that at the same time the degree  is being devalued, sigh!). I was perhaps clumsy in my last sentence, and it certainly came out as elitist or what used to be called snobbish.  Indeed, there are significant numbers of good university graduates who don't make those sorts of distinctions, and it would be hard to argue that one should, but nonetheless, many more people still do make the distinctions. My larger point was that, like it or not, there really are class distinctions in this country, and college is a widely understood class indicator.  I would suggest that it is very difficult today for a young person to be considered 'middle class' without a college degree (of whatever sort) and even more difficult to be 'upper-middle class' without what used to be called a "good" degree - an undergraduate or professional degree from an elite private college or university, or a handful of the public flagships (Michigan, California, Virginia, Vermont, and perhaps North Carolina and Texas).|~|1|~|Monday, February 10, 2014 8:16 AM|~|1238116891|~|1237842078|~|1

There are many more flagships that are highly regarded, and for careers where knowledge is more easily assessed - accounting, engineering, health care, etc. - good regional colleges serve students well.  If you score very high on the Uniform CPA exam, nobody cares where your sheepskin is from.  Most Princeton alumni got in because of superior family connections and/or money, not because they were more brilliant than many thousands of public university students.

Certainly 'middle class' well. But, they will have many, many doors closed to them (unless they demonstrate extraordinary talent) because they don't have "good" or "elite" degrees, and it is very hard for them to move into the upper middle class, let alone the upper reaches of the upper middle class preserves of the elite law, investment banking, and consulting firms, much of the high-tech sector that is full of elite university grads (and drop-outs) and the upper reaches of financial services or executive management.

The professions you cited are credential mad, and to say it more precisely, rely overwhelmingly on cronyism in hiring.  Ivy Leaguers hire Ivy Leaguers, in part because that's a way of validating their self-perceived superiority.  How did Chelsea Clinton (Stanford), who didn't know a debit from a credit, get hired by a major hedge fund as an "analyst"? Thousands of vastly better qualified people were available who had degrees from less publicized colleges.  She had the family name and connections - not superior intellect - and got hired at an extravagant salary.  That's the value of an elite degree. In the business world, outside the few industries you cite, going to an elite school is minimally if at all important.  Many thousands of highly paid partners at CPA firms scored great on the CPA exam and proved their abilities by actual work rather than by relying on signaling credentials.

53779|~|JHay|~|Thanks for this, Kyle--I think you've raised some valid criticisms while being gracious enough to understand the good intent behind We Care Solar's mission.  As a returned Bridge Year student, I feel many of the same frustrations about how international service is conceptualized and applied within the paradigm of "developed" helping "developing."  I agree with you on the dangers of each of your service sins, and remember that avoiding sensationalism was one of my biggest goals going into Bridge Year. At the same time, I realize that my own learning curve has included many of the same sentiments that now rub us both the wrong way.  I'm excited that this team will have the chance to meet with returned BYP-Peru students before they leave to learn a little more about Urubamba, and perhaps change their frame of reference for their role in service.  Being aware of the dangers of sensationalism, salvation narratives, shortsightedness, and simplification in service work is a good first step, and one that can certainly be taken before leaving to go abroad, so thanks for raising the issue--but I also think that it takes time and sometimes on-the-ground experience (paired with the proper humility and willingness to learn, of course) to better understand these essential dynamics of service.  So I hope to read about these students' reflections after they've returned to see how their perspectives on service, particularly international service, have changed as a result. On a different note, I'd recommend ANT 314 (anthropology of development) to Princeton students wanting to think through these issues a bit more; at least it was a helpful class for me in that regard.|~|11|~|Monday, February 3, 2014 2:26 PM|~|1229251028|~|NA|~|1

53450|~|Really?|~|From the perspective of a couple decades beyond my acceptance letter and my baccalaureate graduation day, I respectfully disagree with this premise of this column.  And I’m frankly a bit concerned about what seems to be a sense of an entitlement to be able to avoid ambiguity on important matters of life, and would respectfully advise applicants (and Princeton students if this is a common perspective) to find  their spine on and start to grow up.  The ambiguity of being deferred to the “regular” pool may be a little bit stressful for those who have worked hard, achieved, and who may look at life outcomes as something within their own talents and will to control, but welcome to life. Notwithstanding the talent and will that has brought you success to this point, you’re going to have to face some ambiguity, and some big time ambiguity.  Worrying for a couple of months about whether or not you are going to get into Princeton is not something that anyone should have to protect you from. You’re eighteen, or thereabouts, and in a few years you’ll be launched into the world with the resources to become not only a well functioning adult but a leader.  Welcome to wondering if you’ll get that job, that apartment, and into that graduate program.  Welcome to wondering if the start up you’ve invested the last three years of your time and money in will fly or bomb.  Welcome to wondering if your old buddy from your college team is going to make it through his cancer.  Welcome to wondering if the last fertility treatment cycle you endured with your spouse results in a pregnancy, or if its time to think about adoption.  Welcome to wondering at 3am  if the successful result of that pregnancy or adoption was one of the teenagers hurt or worse in the drunk-driver accident  after the prom.  If you are deferred and not rejected outright, you know that you likely have a very good chance of getting into a very good school, and you’re probably even good enough to find yourself some scholarship money somewhere.  If you’re deferred, you’re left with worrying about whether or not you get into Princeton, but probably not worrying about whether you’ll be going to college at all, or that you’re never going to walk, or see again, or see a loved one again.|~|3|~|Monday, December 22, 2014 12:27 PM|~|1754806136|~|NA|~|0

52794|~|Hythlodaeus|~|In truth, by providing relatively large reading loads to its students, Princeton's professors do their students a rather great favor. Not only do these readings teach students a skill that is extraordinarily useful in an academic context and outside it - skimming - they also provide students with a breadth of reading and knowledge that benefits them in their other courses, in their independent work, and in a variety of future endeavors. The Board's belief that under-prepared students are the cause of lackluster discussions would do themselves well by observing their precepts from the perspective of those who have led precepts. Students in precepts are generally not so much under-prepared as they are either unwilling or unable to process or discuss the material because of the stage of their academic and personal development. This is difficult for students, but these are skills that they must learn with time, not so much by transforming Princeton into a high school replete with daily quizzes and the hand-holding the Editorial Board would have us do in all things but instead by challenging students. By way of an example, I point to that smug STEM-major who commented earlier who is clearly one of these less developed students, reckoning that the length of lectures or number of quizzes determines the difficulty of a course, unable to comprehend the concepts of mastery or creativity in his desperate and shortsighted pursuit of an A and, ultimately, a marginally lucrative career that he no doubt truly earned by a pitiful amount of rote memorization and "hard work." I for one eagerly await his upcoming self-congratulatory TEDx talk, which will be as banal as any of his comments in a precept. But at least he works hard, which is more than anyone can say for the Editorial Board of this periodical, who will no doubt soon churn out yet another column about why they deserve more A-s than B+s.

Less work would result in a more prominent ceiling effect than is already visible among HPY students. Undergraduates should probably consider spending less time writing editorials about the amount of reading they are assigned and more time studying how to use words like "hone" correctly.|~|8|~|Monday, January 6, 2014 9:20 AM|~|1189051749|~|NA|~|1

52794|~|PrincetonGradStudent|~|The ceiling effect has no ethical consequences, as you suggest, but if it were to appear among the Princeton undergraduate population, the ceiling effect might indicate that Princeton students were not receiving a sufficiently challenging education. The premise of this editorial is that most students cannot complete the amount of reading assigned by professors, so the reading load should be lessened to accommodate the abilities of most students. My argument (distilled to two sentences) is that there is an educational benefit to being assigned tasks that initially appear difficult or even impossible. This is not such a radical idea. Moreover, my (snarky) third sentence was meant to express both my surprise that the Princetonian editorial board does not know the correct usage of home/hone and the irony of making such a usage mistake in an editorial advocating lower standards for Princeton undergraduates.|~|0|~|Wednesday, January 8, 2014 12:55 PM|~|1192384766|~|1192054077|~|1

52794|~|Guest|~|PrincetonGradStudent, your assumption is correct. BusinessWritingBlog did the homework for us: >>Merriam-Webster Online says this about "hone in": >>Etymology: Alteration of "home in": to move toward or focus attention on an objective. Merriam-Webster also states that although "hone in" is considered a mistake by commentators, it has established itself in American English--and perhaps in British English as well." I conclude from this that the bastardized use of "hone in" to mean "home in" is in somewhat the same category as "ain't"--it may be commonly used, but usage does not a rule make. In theological terms, it's valid but not licit, and in any case, I would say that even though this usage may be understood in colloquial speech, it has no place in a editorial, where careful writing and respect for editorial and grammatical standards apply.|~|0|~|Wednesday, January 8, 2014 1:44 PM|~|1192479967|~|1192361998|~|0

Because not only do a majority of humanities/social science classes require only two 50-minute lectures plus a 50-minute precept (save for the rare, "scary" 80-minute lecture ones), but your lectures are also 1) delivered at a snail's pace 2) relatively straightforward, save for some upper-level ones. You can afford to do the extra hundred pages of reading when you don't have to: -Go to two 80-minute or three 50-minute lectures a week, plus precept, and usually a 3 hour lab. -Sit through lectures that are fast-paced, detail-oriented, and not straightforward like a humanities class. -Take multiple midterms that are at least 2 hours long (not just a quick 50 minute in-class one) and spend at least a week in advance studying your ass off and pushing off other classes to the side to prepare for them -Finishing weekly problem sets, quantitative assignments, or lab reports -Needing to review over the material constantly unless you want to fall behind You're never expected to know all of the readings for the precept, but at some point you should at least make a half-assed effort to compensate for the workload differential in your easy classes by going back over the readings. Because at least in humanities and social science classes, you can afford to miss lectures, skip readings, and still get an A on the midterm/final by bullshitting your way through an easy curriculum. Do the readings when you don't even have work to begin with - don't complain. Engineers, math, and the sciences have it way harder than you - oh and, yeah, we also have to do readings from our textbooks, too.

Poor analysis. For instance, if science course lectures are not "straight forward" then perhaps they are not organized and delivered well. Maybe science courses are "harder" because the design features you list are not conducive to learning. Also, you are probably comparing apples to oranges in terms of TYPE of course--introductory, survey courses outside of your major (taken to meet requirements) to more in-depth conceptually and theoretically challenging courses in your major. I sense this because if you believe all lectures in SS/H are "straight forward" you must only have listened to simple ones.|~|0|~|Wednesday, January 8, 2014 9:02 AM|~|1192062441|~|1188748928|~|0
52794|~|good, bad and ugly|~|Time cost studies indicate that college students now spend far less time studying and doing assigned reading for classes than students even a couple of decades ago.  Leisure time absorbs most of the difference.  They also indicate that humanities and social science students spend about as much time doing assigned class work as STEM students (with more time spent on reading and less time on problem sets). Always a bit hard to say how well these kind of national studies apply to Princeton students, but there is clearly a trade-off between time spent doing school work and time spent at parties, extracurricular activities and browsing the web -- and students everywhere (including Princeton) are doing more of the latter and less of the former.  The editorial writers are really urging faculty to facilitate time spent on other things.  This isn't about the human limits on how much reading can be done in a week.  This is about whether Princeton undergrads are part-time students or full-time students.|~|6|~|Monday, January 6, 2014 9:34 AM|~|1189067622|~|NA|~|1

52794|~|07|~|I agree with the spirit of the idea entirely, except for the part where this seems to be the first student editorial ever to propose pop quizzes, and I think guided reading would only be useful in very select cases.  One of my favorite classes was built entirely around Heidegger's "Being and Time."  However, given the complexity of that work, I can't decide whether that was a more or less informative/worthy class than those with much longer reading assignments. To PrincetonGradStudent, I don't see how the ceiling effect is at all relevant here.  If the assigned task is simply to complete reading assignments and remember arbitrary amounts of information, then yes, reducing the amount of reading would obviously make it easier.  However, as far as I can recall, almost all actual assignments in humanities classes aim to evaluate a student's depth of understanding, as opposed to breadth of remembered facts (whether or not that is the appropriate bar is another question).  If a student has to read 10 books over a course of an English class, it is possible/probable that he will only have to discuss a minority of them in essays for that class (presumably reading and understanding every assignment will help a student write a good essay on an individual book, but it is not a pre-requisite to getting a passing grade; nominal precept participation grades might account somewhat for whether the student actually read every book, but that also doesn't seem to be a major focus). While the grades might not reflect much differentiation among students, it is difficult for me to believe that humanities professors actually struggle to differentiate between their students' essays: Princeton never had an issue with too many students receiving A+'s, just A's and A-'s.  If this type of diferrentiation is possible and non-random, there is no ceiling effect (this also assumes the difference between an A- and A is greater than, say, the difference between getting 98% and 99% of answers on a test correct; I don't like forcing professors to give certain grades, but I still find it hard to believe that meaningful differentiation is impossible). To Hythlodaeus - Having sat in my fair share of precepts, and having known my fair share of fellow precept attendees, it is definitely true that many students do not participate simply because they are not well prepared.  However, there is also some truth to your view, as I know I was always hesitant to chime in if I was only 90% sure I had something correct or informative to say (though I would never chime in if I was only 30% sure I had something informative to say, and that had to do with preparation). Princeton2016 - As a physics turned philosophy major, I agree with your general view on the rigor of humanities vs. sciences classes (though I suppose this backrgound doesn't truly make me unbiased).  There is more truth than you credit to your comment that humanities lectures are "relatively straightforward, save for some upper-level ones."  I had precisely the same thoughts regarding my lower level physics and math classes (i.e. 200 level or lower)...other than the extra lab time involved for physics, these were no more rigrous than the average courses I took at Princeton; the more or less compulsory 100-level physics classes were among the least rigorous (the actual least rigorous were econ classes, though I am definitely biased by my sample there).  The caveat is that getting a B in a mid/upper level humanities class is clearly much easier than getting a B in a similar level math/science/engineering class (excepting that in at least one class, the opposite of the ceiling effect was in place, as a 40% turned out to be an A-) McGrin - I believe that is oftenthe type of reading assigned today.  It might no longer be "regularly" the case, but it is by no means atypical.|~|1|~|Tuesday, January 7, 2014 11:16 AM|~|1190655540|~|NA|~|1
52512|~|Princeton Alum 2000|~|Regrading?  Are you kidding me?  The sense of entitlement that today's students have is mind boggling.  Essentially what editorial board is asking for is to give students the right to haggle for better grades.  Can a mistake be made by a professor or TA when grading yes, in that case a student should be allowed to bring it to the attention of the department; however this should be the exception not the rule and it would completely bog the system down if every student who felt entitled to an A instead of a B+ was given the opportunity to have their paper regraded. Students should also know that there are already a number of checks and balances in place when grading exams, especially with larger classes where most exams are reviewed by multiple people. I don't disagree that students should have their written exams returned to them, this was the case in all of my classes when I attended Princeton and it was helpful to see what areas one missed especially within his or her major but regrading is for the over coddled who don't want to put in the work but still want to get credit.|~|3|~|Thursday, December 19, 2013 9:07 PM|~|1170978300|~|NA|~|1
52512|~|SeattleStudent|~|I agree completely with Princeton Alum 2000.  As a current instructor, I never return or comment on final work unless a student asks for it.  Way fewer than 10% of students do so, even when they are in a course with me the following term.  It's a waste of time to make comments that hardly any students will read.  If you are so interested in learning from your prior papers, why don't you schedule an appointment with the instructor to go over them?  I can't imagine that request is frequently denied, if ever.  As written, this editorial reeks (as the other comment points out) of whiny students who want some sort of lame "procedural right" to grade grub and complain.  I'm sure you can request your work if you really want to see it.  "Regrading" is only necessary if the faculty member has made a terrible error, which happens so rarely as to render this whole conversation practically moot, and more than a little annoying.

This is why neural room to room maturation wait time is necessary before even bothering to say anything.    Hence, the real issue is timing, knowing when and how to also deliver the  message since listeners must be able to both perceptually process and  accept the message [and not ones the pop-media is sending either.]   Thus it is going to depend on social maturity of message recipients, that time might  be now, or....near future.  Listeners on both sides have to be able to get past that, before a  comfort zone can be established. Otherwise, silence remains "golden" -  not just as a rule, but as a defense mechanism too.

This statement is particularly insightful: "I knew that having these feelings didn’t mean that I was anti-Israel, but my friend bought into the false dichotomy that has dominated conversations about Israel for too long: that to be pro-Israel meant to unilaterally support every Israeli policy and that to be anything else was to be anti-Israel, and even worse, anti-Semitic." There is no reason that I should have to support every Israeli policy and administration (eg Likud) to avoid being called anti-Israel, just like I shouldn't be called anti-American simply because I don't support all of America's policies.

In point of fact, he states very clearly that the fault for the Palestinian refugee problem lies with them and the war they themselves started. |~|0|~|Thursday, November 21, 2013 5:11 PM|~|1133574732|~|1133567819|~|1

49670|~|Eric11210|~|Two very important comments: 1. Israel initiated the Oslo peace process and has always been ready for a two state solution. It is the so called Palestinians who have refused at every turn every offer ever made to them. 2. The Land of Israel is the ancestral homeland of the Jewish people. The ancestral homeland of the Arabs calling themselves Palestinians is the Arabian Peninsula. Israel has offered repeatedly to give away part of the Jewish ancestral home in the name of peace but such offers have been refused every time because the so called Palestinians are not interested in a two state solution. They want a single Arab state which will be judenrein. BTW, I realize it's unpopular in certain circles to refer to the Arabs in this part of the world as "so called Palestinians." There is a reason for this which should be appreciated by anyone who cares to study history. Prior to the founding of the State of Israel, document after document shows that the Palestinians were Jews. All the primary sources in fact show us that the Arabs called themselves "southern Syrians" and had no interest in a state of their own. Indeed, in the 19 years that Jordan controlled the land west of the Jordan river (the so called "West Bank" is another name made up in recent years which has no historical context. It refers to the land illegally seized by Jordan west of the river following Israel's war of independence), the Arabs who now call themselves Palestinians never once tried to create a state of their own. Never once made a single request to the King of Jordan for such a state. Never said a word to Nasser about getting Gaza for a state. An honest historian can only come to one conclusion based on these simple facts. Referring to the Arabs as "Palestinians" is intellectually dishonest.|~|2|~|Thursday, November 21, 2013 10:53 AM|~|1132869254|~|NA|~|1
49670|~|Nick|~|To your first point, the most recent offer I can remember Israel making Palestine was Ehud Barak's offer in the early 2000s.  Although pro-Israeli commentators trumpeted that offer was "97% of what the Palestinians wanted," if you look at a map, you see that the 97% is divided between 3 non-continuous chunks of land and Gaza without a connection to Gaza.  Israel designed this strange territorial division so they could fold major settlements like Hebron into Israel's final territory.  Furthermore, Israel would have maintained control over the Jordan river and most of the airspace over these territories.  A country that is 4 disconnected chunks and does not have control over its own airspace or water supply is hardly a state. So while I think your first point has some validity, I think you are missing the underhandedness of Israeli negotiation as Palestinians experience it. Your second point seems kind of irrelevant to me.  Israel/Palestine has been the ancestral homeland of dozens of peoples throughout human history, including many nations that ancient Israelites defeated or exterminated to clear space for their settlement of Canaan.  Do the Jews have a special claim because their ancient ancestors came out on top?  Sure the Jews are the oldest still-existing claimant, but Arabs living in Palestine have viewed Palestine as Waqif (divine grant of land by Allah) for the last thousand years. The Israel-Palestine debacle is a conflict of Right vs. Right.  That's exactly the problem: both sides have very strong arguments in their favor and both sides have done horrible things.  If you reflexively thinking the Palestinians have done worse things, look up the Chabra and Chatilla massacres, where the IDF allowed Marionite Christians in Lebanon to massacre Palestinian refugees. Although I see Israel and Palestine's cases as roughly equal, Israel is the much stronger party, which means it's fundamentally in their power to make a fair offer and end the conflict.  For a variety of reasons, including the illegal settlements discussed above, Israel has yet to make a fair offer (to my knowledge -- I invite any and all corrections).|~|1|~|Thursday, November 21, 2013 12:50 PM|~|1133104282|~|1132869254|~|1
49670|~|Eric11210|~|You mean this map? Looks pretty contiguous to me. And part of the offer included a safe passage road between Gaza and the rest of the land that would have made up the new "State of Palestine:"       View       Hide          BTW, The United States is not contiguous to all of her territory. If you want to drive to Alaska, you need to go through Canada and there's not even a safe passage route between the two. Regarding your second comment, yes, there were ancient peoples whom the ancient Hebrews defeated. However, this is true all over the planet. There is no place on Earth that has not been conquered and seen those who were there before forced out. Heck, Princeton is built on land stolen from Native Americans. Bottom line is that just as the United States has the right to the land based on what happened centuries ago, the Jews too have the right to their land. One more comment regarding Sabra and Shatila since you bring it up: Israel didn't "let" the Christian Arabs do anything. The Israelis brought in the South Lebanese Army to clear out the terrorists who had murdered their leader the day before. Did the Israelis know some people would be killed? 100% they did. They expected the SLA to kill the terrorist leaders. They didn't know until later that the SLA had simply engaged in wholesale slaughter of all their fellow Arabs. Then again, if you blame Israel for that, you may as well blame Israel for the mess in Syria where 100,000 Arabs have been murdered by their fellow Arabs and Israel has refused to intervene to stop the bloodshed. |~|1|~|Thursday, November 21, 2013 1:13 PM|~|1133146147|~|1133104282|~|1

There's a famous reel of Arafat holding it up and making fun of it  -- I'll post an image if I can find one.  I'm not very familiar with this 2008 offer, so I'm interested in how it addresses the following points: (1) Who gets Jerusalem? (2) Does Palestine get control of its own airspace and the Jordan River? (3) Do Palestinian refugees get a right of return as mandated by multiple UN Resolutions? I'd love to hear what you know and what you think about these 3 points?|~|0|~|Thursday, November 21, 2013 2:27 PM|~|1133291007|~|1133146147|~|1
49670|~|Eric11210|~|Mea culpa. This is the map submitted to Arafat at the 2001 Taba talks. Once again, looks pretty contiguous to me:       View       Hide          Regarding your other questions about Olmert's proposals: 1. Olmert's proposal was to offer the "State of Palestine" part of Jerusalem with shared sovereignty in the old city.  2. The Palestinian state would be required to be demilitarized under such an agreement, which means they'd be able to fly their own aircraft but wouldn't be allowed to bring in military aircraft.  3. There is no such UN resolution. There are UNGA resolutions but those are not international law. They are merely suggestions and have no status under international law. Any right of return would be to the newly created State of Palestine. A "right of return" to Israel would be a nonstarter because the whole point of a two state solution is to separate the peoples. Insisting that Israel be swamped with 6 million Arabs, 90% of whom have never set foot there would destroy Israel and lead to a two Arab state solution with the Jews slaughtered in their own land. |~|1|~|Thursday, November 21, 2013 3:09 PM|~|1133359979|~|1133291007|~|1
49670|~|Nick|~|I did not address your points about ancestry.  I agree with you that the US has similarly appropriated it's territory, but that does not answer my question.  You claimed Israel was the ancestral homeland of the Jewish people, as if that gave them a special right to the land.  Is that your assertion?  If so, you have not offered much evidence for that claim nor have you explained why the Palestinian conception of Palestine as a waqif does not warrant a similar claim to the land. To the Olmert agreement: (1) seems fair to me. To (2), a state that can't have its own military is not much of state.  What's to prevent Israel from shoving the new Palestine around?  Definitely need to get rid of (2). To (3), you're right about the UNGA resolutions, but you're forgetting UN Security Council Resolution 242 which calls for "achieving a just settlement of the refugee problem."  You're also forgetting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and the Geneva Conventions of 1949, which both emphasize an individual right to return to one's own country.  How is it just to say to a refugee in Jordan -- perhaps someone who still has the pre-1948 deed to their house in Israeli territory! -- "tough luck."  Israel should at least compensate refugees for whom a right of return is not feasible. And, frankly, the Jewish character of Israel is already at risk because Israeli Arabs are growing much faster than Jewish Israelis.  Given that, allowing Palestinians to return to Israel would just accelerate the inevitable.|~|1|~|Thursday, November 21, 2013 4:40 PM|~|1133531252|~|1133359979|~|1
49670|~|Eric11210|~|Israel has legitimate security concerns. A fully militarized Palestinian state would pose an existential threat to Israel given that it could slice Israel in half at its narrowest point, just 9 miles wide. Allowing a new state of Palestine to have more than a police force would be a non starter. This is perfectly just and there are a large number of states in the world which have no military to speak of. What would stop Israel from pushing around a newly created Palestine? Simple -- world condemnation. If Israel signs a peace agreement, she will honor it just as she has honored agreements with Jordan and Egypt, even when both nations violated the agreements they signed. As to your other questions: A just solution as called for in 242 does NOT call for Israel to become an Islamic state. That would be unjust solution in the extreme. Moreover, chapter VI resolutions are similarly not considered to be international law. Under the UN charter, they are recommendations. 90% of the so called refugees have never set foot in Israel. The UNHRC, which rules all refugees EXCEPT for the so called Palestinian refugees defines as refugees only those who left their homes involuntarily after having lived there most of their lives. This fiction of creating new refugees by conferring the status indefinitely exists nowhere else in the world and should be dismantled. Moreover, the UN has always called for refugees to be resettled or repatriated, but repatriated only where feasible. It is not feasible here so it;s a non starter. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights does not have the status of international law retroactively. It came into effect as international law only in 1976. Moreover, it never grants any "right of return" to refugees. It merely grants the right to asylum in other countries. Geneva Conventions do not confer right of return to refugees either and are in any event similarly not retroactive. Even those who are legitimately refugees (today, no more than a few thousand people) were almost exclusively RENTERS. They never claim to have the deed to their homes. They have keys and nothing more. Finally, regarding your last question, so does this mean that you support ethnic cleansing of the Arabs from Israel once a State of Palestine has been established? After all, you have already made clear that you support ethnic cleansing of Jews from the new state of Palestine, which must be rendered judenrein. Since I'll go with the assumption that you only support forcing Jews from their homes, I will tell you that the demographic models all predict a Jewish majority for the foreseeable future. Your assumptions are completely wrong and based on nothing but propaganda. One last thing: In regards to your claim that the Land of Israel is not the ancestral home of the Jewish people, please find yourself some decent archeology professors over at Princeton. You are obviously just reading the fiction that propagandists endlessly push. There is overwhelming evidence showing this is the ancestral home of the Jewish people.|~|2|~|Thursday, November 21, 2013 4:52 PM|~|1133549474|~|1133531252|~|1
49670|~|Nick|~|Whoa, Eric, I didn't mean to get you so worked up.  I also ask that you stop throwing around claims of propaganda.  In my first post, I called for the correction of any mistakes I made and you have graciously done so (I'm working off the memory of books I read 8-10 years ago, so forgive me if I lose details).  If I get something wrong, it's me being an idiot, not me spouting propaganda.  I would have to review a lot to meet your points about the right of return, so let's table that. I never claimed to want the "ethnic cleansing of Jews from the new state of Palestine."  Heck, I would not even dismantle the Jewish settlements if they would submit to Palestinian sovereignty.  I also did not claim that Israel was not the ancestral homeland of the Jewish people.  Instead, I asked you, given the dozens of peoples who have lived there, what an "ancestral homeland" means, why that gives the Jewish people an exclusive right to the land, and why a millenia of the waqif of Palestine does not create an equivalent right.  I would also like to see your demographic projections, because I have read the opposite and I would like to confirm one of our views. Yes, Israel has legitimate military concerns, but so does Palestine.  Israel could re-conquer a liberated Palestine whenever it feels like it.  Did global condemnation of Israeli incursions into Gaza and Lebanon stop the IDF from continuing?  Plus, the IDF would be able to crush any military force Palestine could muster.|~|1|~|Thursday, November 21, 2013 5:39 PM|~|1133620596|~|1133549474|~|1
49670|~|Eric11210|~|I see too many people calling for the destruction of Israel and so I assume that when I see something like what you wrote, you've decided to swallow whole all the nonsense being pushed endlessly. As to your questions: 1. Are you aware that "Palestinian" law calls for the death penalty for anyone selling land to a Jew? How would that work then with people in the settlements "submitting" to Palestinian sovereignty? Would they all need to be executed because they own land, which is forbidden to Jews? 2. Every place on earth has had dozens of peoples who called it home at one point or another. However, only the Jews who have a claim reaching back to antiquity in the Land of Israel. The so called Palestinians are primarily migrants who entered during the 19th and 20th centuries because they wanted to get jobs from Jews coming home to their ancient land.  3. Your question about demographics: http://www.bostonglobe.com/opi... 4. Israel has never been the one to start wars. On every occasion, it was the Arabs who started the wars against Israel and Israel was forced to defend herself. Even in 1967, when Israel launched a pre-emptive strike, it was following acts of war by the Egyptians, including closing the straights of Tiran and breaking the cease fire agreement demilitarizing the Sinai. I think this shows who has the real military concerns and it wouldn't be a "State of Palestine." As long as said state is willing to live at peace and not lob thousands upon thousands of rockets at Israel as Gaza has been doing ever since Israel walked away.  5. The incursions in Gaza and Lebanon WERE IN RESPONSE TO ATTACKS ON ISRAEL! Or do you believe that Israel shouldn't have gone into Lebanon after her soldiers were murdered and kidnapped and Israel shouldn't have gone into Gaza after her citizens were terrorized by 10,000 rockets?  6. If "Palestine" is allowed to make military alliances, they could simply muster forces from the entire Arab world, which would try to crush Israel. |~|1|~|Saturday, November 23, 2013 1:49 PM|~|1136147770|~|1133620596|~|1
49670|~|Nick|~|Answers to your points: 1.  Fair point.  The settlements will probably need to be broken up or annexed to Israel in any final peace agreement.  You do agree that those settlements were formed in direct contravention to international law, right?  If that's the case, a Palestinian request for the return of the land would be legitimate.  Especially since Israel has been promising that land for peace with Palestine since 1967.  I think annexing them to Israel is the better answer -- I just want to make sure we agree that the settlements should never have been settled in the first place. 2. Why does the duration of a connection to a specific hunk of land matter?  I think you're missing my point.  I'm trying to show that a special connection to a hunk of land is silly, especially when that special connection leads you to create half a century of war over that hunk of land.  Especially when that hunk of land contains the Jerusalem, the holiest city for Jews and Christians, and the third holiest city for Muslims.  When you claim a city like that as your ancestral right, you're asking for a religious war.  After WWII the Jews could have established a state in empty land in Uruguay or Uganda and we all could have avoided this turmoil in the Middle East.  Instead, they picked some of the most contested land on the planet.  I understand the attachment to Judea, but was that special connection to an ancestral homeland really worth all the bloodshed. 3. Interesting.  I'll concede this point for the sake of argument. 4. Technically, yes.  I would argue that forcing the Partition Plan of 1947 on the Arab states could only produce war.  True, those Arab states violated international law in declaring war, but objecting to Israel's sudden insertion into the region seems a legitimate grievance to me (see my answers to 2). I would also argue that modern Israeli responses to attacks are disproportionate to the harm to Israel.  Yeah, rockets every day suck and kill a couple of people, but killing 10 times as many people in Gaza, along with cutting off water and power to many more is an overreaction. 5.  You're missing my point.  I was demonstrating that global outrage has never really restrained Israel.  If you want a different example, take the bombing of the Iraqi reactor in the 1980s that killed a couple of Europeans.  Tons of outrage and Israel did not care because preventing regional nuclear proliferation is more important to Israel than making friends with the world community.  And that's certainly one of Israel's most important strategic interests.  But that means that we cannot rely on world outrage and Israeli courtesy to prevent the IDF from pushing other people in the region around when Israel thinks its security is threatened.  Of course Israel has a right to security, but wouldn't you agree that Israel has a very proactive understanding of that right (e.g. the pre-emptive strike in 1967, aggressive responses to violence in Lebabon and Gaza, and so forth).  Given that, leaving Palestine demilitarized is an invitation for Israel to get over-aggressive in pursuit of its security.  I suspect a liberated Palestine with no military would spend half of its existence on IDF lockdown and world outrage would do nothing to prevent Israel from defending its interests. And to your question about Gaza, the proportionality of the response matters.  Of course Israel was justified in doing something, but those thousands of rockets have killed far fewer people than the Israeli incursions responding to them. 6.  Very unlikely.  The Arab world is currently fractured, so I doubt Palestine could assemble the allies to seriously challenge the IDF.  Plus, the USA would never let that happen. In short, I think a just and lasting peace has to including the following: (1) a Palestinian military (2) some sort of compensation for refugees displaced from the modern borders of Israel, but no right of return (3) Palestinian control of its section of the Jordan river, its airspace, and its power (where possible -- this may not be in parts of Gaza) (4) some agreement over Jerusalem; I think the best answer is to turn Jerusalem into an international city, but neither side will accept that, so probably a division of the city and equal access to the Temple Mount / Al-Aksa Mosque. (5) resolution of the illegal settlements -- I think the best answer is to annex them to Israel and give something nice to the Palestinians like an elevated highway to Gaza. (6) No lasting Israeli security presence in Palestine. You have described (1) as a non-starter and I suspect you will have objections to my solutions in (2), (3), and maybe (6).  I'd love to hear you out, but I thnk that fact that 1-3 of the items in my lisy (which I think a netural observer would describe as fair) are non-starters for Israeli negotiators.  Don't you think the Israeli position is a little too extreme? I also have a new question for you: why is continuing to support Israel advantageous to the USA?  And please give me a useful, quantifiable answer like "we do x billion dollars of trade that would not happen without American support of Israel" as opposed to "Israel is the only democracy in the region and we need to support them."  As was said of the 19th century British empire, America ought to have permanent interests and not permanent friends.  We have this "special relationship," but being friends with Israel has only increased hatred of the USA in the middle east.  While I don't necessarily agree with all of Obama's diplomacy, I at least like that he does not feel the need to buddy up with Netanyahou. And this is why I support some of the comments decrying the immense influence of the Israel Lobby in American politics.  I agree that there has been a lot of trolling on this thread, and I apologize for some of the anti-semitic crap that's been thrown your way.  But I challenge you to show me that the support America has provided over the the last 50 years is at all proportional to the benefits Americans have accrued from our alliance with Israel.|~|0|~|Monday, November 25, 2013 7:11 PM|~|1138886130|~|1136147770|~|1
49670|~|Eric11210|~|1. I concede no such point. Under the terms of the Treaty of Sevres, which broke up the Ottoman Empire, the land was granted to the Jews. The Arabs agreed in the Faisal-Weizmann agreement that they would get 77% of the land and the Jews the remaining 23%. They then broke the agreement soon after. Thus Israel has a right to all the land west of the Jordan River. The argument that you and yours make on the 4th Geneva Convention is a non starter because it ignores the very clear directives in article 2 which may very clear that there are no "Palestinian" rights to the land since no state legally owned the land, thus the last international agreements (i.e. The Treaty of Sevres and the League of Nations Mandate for Palestine) take precedence. The ICRC simply ignored what article 2 says and pretended that they were being fair minded.  2. An indigenous people is any people with a continuous connection to a piece of land since the advent of modern states. The first modern state was the Kingdom of France, created in the 5th Century. Only the Jews can claim indigenous rights to the land then. Most of the Arabs arrived in the 19th century.  4. That is a dumb argument. There was NO REASON WHATSOEVER FOR A WAR OF GENOCIDE CONDUCTED BY YOUR FRIENDS.  NONE. . Anyone trying to pretend they had a right or justification for their calls to "make the streets flow with Jewish blood" is either deluding himself or sick or both. Period.  5. On the contrary. If the UN and the rest of world hadn't intervened, Israel would have crushed Hezbollah and Hamas once and for all instead of being forced to constantly watch them re-arm after they laugh at international agreements.  6. The Arab world was fractured in 1948, 1967 and 1972 too. Didn't stop them then. Wouldn't stop them now. Let me be clear: In 1946, Germany was forced, following a war of genocide on Poland, to give up land she conquered along with part of her own homeland. The Poles ethnically cleansed 95% of the Germans from their homes. The Germans understood they'd started a genocidal war and lost and as such, they accepted that this was the price of their efforts to murder Jews and Poles. Your friends started a genocidal war just two years later against the Jews and then again in 1967. This was after they broke an agreement giving them 77% of the original land of the Palestine Mandate. Not to mention after the British illegally ceded land to the French mandate of Syria in the Golan (land which was then ethnically cleansed of Jews who had purchased land there but who were never paid for their losses). They lost the war. Plain and simple. They tried again and again to destroy Israel and they lost every time. Israel has offered to make peace but given the history of the Arabs, whom to this day do not acknowledge the right of Israel to exist in peace and security, Israel must demand security guarantees in order to protect herself. As for your question about American benefits from the alliance with Israel:  http://www.foreignaffairs.com/...|~|0|~|Monday, November 25, 2013 7:34 PM|~|1138907163|~|1138886130|~|1

49670|~|thinkingthinker|~|AJ, perhaps by this post you can see how closely tied anti-semitism and anti-zionism/anti-israelism are. there is a legitimate point to the concept that israeli settlements are a problem, but this is something that gets blown completely out of proportion in the whole issue.  a couple of points -- 1) turkey currently occupies northern cyprus defacto, and have you heard of recent UN resolutions about this?  china occupies tibet, but that issue is barely mentioned as well.  yet the united nations recently voted on about 10 anti-israeli resolutions in one day, while thousands of people are being killed monthly in syria.  why?  why the disproportionate focus on israel? 2) while again the presence of settlements is not helpful, this is clearly not the root of the conflict.  the conflict began at least in 1948, if not earlier.  the first settlements were in the aftermath of the 1967 war. those who yell and cry about israel being "evil", "racist" and causing "genocide" of the palestinians (and this frequently degenerates into ironic observations of how jews are like the nazis who murdered them) really ignore the facts.  what has happened has been a long running conflict and one side has won most of the time, the other has lost, and the results of the continued conflict is that the losing side (who has no interest yet in ending the conflict, as they feel that they have been wronged) has suffered quite a bit.  you have to realize that in 1948, when this conflict may have begun, the balance of strength was quite a bit different than today, and while that balance of strength has changed, what has not changed is the motivation to continue the conflict.  continued conflict leads to victors and victims.  victims suffer.  victors often aren't very nice to the victims.   the jews of 1948 only avoided being victims by winning a brutal war. but the demonization of israel promotes continuation of the conflict.  therefore, if you feel honestly that you want to play a role in this, please remember, there are children, parents, and all sorts of people in israel with normal hopes and dreams who just want to live an ordinary life, just like you.  they have no interest in continuing a conflict for the sake of some "holy land" if it means that their brothers, children or husbands will be at risk. however, telling them that their country is illegal, that they are interlopers who need to "go back to europe" (where their grandparents were killed), doesn't help to end a conflict.  telling them that zionism is evil, instead of a movement which allowed jews to live a free people in their own country without persecution for the first time in 2000 years, doesn't help to end a conflict.  telling them that they "control the media" or "control the government", which is what their grandparents heard just before they got herded into cattle cars, also won't help. realizing that israel is actually a tiny little country (10 miles wide in some points) on the edge of a currently very violent middle east, may help.  and finally, realizing that anti-semitism is a very real thing, and that a good number of anti-zionists are anti-semites, will definitely help. thanks|~|3|~|Thursday, November 21, 2013 10:28 AM|~|1132818246|~|1131500071|~|1

49670|~|LionofSepharad|~|"The answer requires only a brief look at Israel’s history: four wars, two Palestinian uprisings, persistent terrorist attacks and tens of thousands of deaths on both sides — Israeli and Arab. The entire 65 years of Israel’s existence starkly expose the infeasibility of peaceful coexistence within one state." This in itself represents either a lack of historical knowledge, or a lie. Of the four major wars Israel has been involved in (1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973), three of them took place before Israel ever gained what the Arab Philistines (it's the most direct translation of the Arabic) now claim as their state. In 1948, there could have been a two-state solution, but the Arabs said 'no' and their nations attempted to invade and destroy Israel. The Arabs controlled the West Bank and Gaza from 1949-1967; Jordan controlled the West Bank and Egypt controlled Gaza, and there was no 'State of Palestine'. There could've been a three-state solution then, but the Egyptians blockaded the straits of tiran and Syria and Jordan declared war on Israel. Israel has retreated far too much, Israel left Lebanon and Hezbollah took over, Israel left Gaza and Hamas took over. Who is there to make peace with? Iran? Hezbollah? Hamas? Even Fatah and Mahmoud Abbas, a group which refuses to recognise Israel as a state for Jews, who openly in their Arabic speeches, make note that any two-state solution is a temporary treaty and the goal is still destroying Israel; would that be true peace? And even if Abbas were serious, can he represent the Arabs of Gaza who live under Hamas or the Arabs of the West Bank he refuses to hold elections in for fear of losing again (as he did to Hamas in 2006)?  J Street is misguided at best, and dangerous at worst. Surely, of all the causes in the world, even in the Middle East, Israel is not the main problem. The Arabs do not need another state, the ones they already have are breaking up; there is still slavery in Mauritania, there is chaos and a true war on terrorism in Somalia, there is genocide against Blacks in Sudan, there is de-facto slave-labour conditions of South Asian migrant workers in the Gulf, not to mention the lack of rights for women in many Arab countries and LGBT in all of them. If J Street truly wanted an end to the conflict, they would see that if the world accepted the West Bank as part of Israel, then Arabs would have more rights in Israel than they would in any Arab country. Over 80% of the Arabs in the West Bank live in the small Areas A and B of the Oslo Accord, Area C is 70% Jewish and could easily be brought into Israel proper, while Areas A and B could be as well, as an Arab autonomous region with a regional parliament. Anything else would, like the Israeli retreats from Lebanon and Gaza, just lead to further attacks on Israel.|~|3|~|Thursday, November 21, 2013 10:13 PM|~|1133939151|~|NA|~|1
49670|~|Cpt_Justice|~|We have only this side of the story. I keep *hearing* that "Jews say everyone who is merely anti Israel is antisemitic", but, FWIS, all I can see is a lot of people unfairly (& usually ignorantly) criticizing Israel in such a way as to at least intimate that they do, indeed, just hate Jews. In this case, even if the author thought his remarks were innocent, the fact remains is that the so-called "settlements" really *can't* be "antagonistic to the peace process" because it's only been recently (at least relatively speaking) that anyone has even begun to consider them as such. What was the excuse ten years ago (for example)? The author of the piece sounds like he just sucked up whatever the media was telling him without really thinking.

49670|~|Guest|~|I couldn't disagree more - settlements have always been antagonistic to the peace process, but regardless of any past narratives, settlements are communities that Israel is building on land that will become part of a future Palestinian state, and are illegal under international law. What's your argument in favor of settlement building? They hurt the security of the state of Israel and move us further away from a two-state solution, which is the only way that Israel can ensure it's long-term existence as a Jewish and Democratic state. The author of this column is clearly a critically thinking Princeton University student who began to realize that working towards a two-state solution through J Street U was the best way to engage with this issue in a way that was meaningful and constructive after having the experience he describes. Saying that he "just sucked up whatever the media was telling him without really thinking" is not only inaccurate, it's a wrongful attack on his character.|~|10|~|Thursday, November 21, 2013 1:12 AM|~|1132279432|~|1132247641|~|1

49670|~|Michael Hess|~|"aj" great story. Except you are missing the point. There is no REAL antisemitism anymore. There is ONLY the new definition used by Israel's Likud government and 'bagger led GOP types who are waiting for the Second Coming(tm) that is never going to happen. You see "aj", the wingnuts have rendered the term "antisemitism" meaningless. As you note at the beginning of your essay, you were abused by wingnuts and termed as antisemitic even though you were simply stating the truth. I too advocated for a fair and durable peace settlement for DECADES and have been called an anti-Semite on a daily basis, had death threats, been questioned about my American Indian heritage and in general faced by nothing but wingnuts who refuse to deal with historic truth. So, in addition to those reasons and the fact that the Ethnic Cleansing Israel was born in, the Nakba never being acknowledged, and the fact that the same Ethnic Cleansing that marks all of Israel's history continues even as I write this with tens of thousands of Bedouin being cleansed right now. That is how antisemitism changed me from being a supporter of Israel to absolutely being against the state of Israel with every fiber of my being. Due to Israel's intransigence over past decades, and the continued intransigence of Israel that causes so much of the world's terrorism and dysfunction in American government I believe Israel should be kicked out of the United Nations and that the next stop for the rogue state after that should be the ICC to face a long list of charges including War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity that have long gone unanswered.

49572|~|Baker Street Irregular #36|~|Cartoon is particularly true of freshman year, when A is IMPOSSIBLE due to the pass-fail plan... I wrote a song about it, to the tune of the Rutgers alma-mater ("On the banks of the old Raritan") "My father sent me to old Cambridge And resolved that I should be a man So he sent me to work and never to shirk But he forgot about the pass-fail plan! CHORUS:  So damn the pass-fail plan!                   And curse the day it all began!                   For why study all the day if you never get an A?                   God damn the pass-fail plan! How I loved taking quizzes in high school! I'd be ecstatic on grade-report day! All my classmates thought I was perverted, But I just loved the sight of an A! CHORUS How my high school A's would excite me! But I can't get off on a row full of N's   (*)    I used to keep my report cards beneath my pillow Now I just rip them up and throw them in the Fens! CHORUS: People say I never had a girlfriend People say I'll never find a wife But I don't really care if I can breathe this Cambridge air And get report cards full of As all my life! FINAL CHORUS *Note:  "N" meant pass back when I was a tech tool (Course 2-A, class of 1978) After freshman year, it wasn't too hard to get an A ....  if you did nothing but study 16 hours a day and had no other life!  I think the cartoon means, that at Yale, you can get As while still having a life!|~|2|~|Friday, November 22, 2013 10:53 PM|~|1135373095|~|NA|~|1

48298|~|SFB|~|Nice of Spencer to give some support to the grad students. On one hand, I like the idea of grads (and even undergrad students) living integrated in the local town community. On the other hand, the local community has a very expensive rental market and many local residents and elected officials oppose the construction of apartments that might attract graduate students. Never mind the 'long walk from Lawrence apartments' (lol), many grads are taking apartments in West Windsor and Plainsboro township in an effort to find somewhere to live. That's not good for the University community.|~|0|~|Monday, November 11, 2013 11:18 PM|~|1119010614|~|NA|~|1

47773|~|bill@19D|~|First off I don’t know the decision making process that led to the comments section on original article that addressed this talk being pulled but it does seem odd to be talking about talking about how this event was such a great example of free speech when the comments section that was highly critical of Ryan Anderson was pulled. Secondly I am very open to the idea that universities should be open to hearing from certain speakers who hold extreme positions however if this is to happen then the university needs to be honest both to itself and to everyone else about this. This means evaluating the speaker on their full record and not just one area of their work and with Ryan Anderson this means acknowledging the fact that this goes far beyond marriage as most recently evidenced by his opposition to ENDA. We are talking about an opposition to people even accepting the fact that they are gay, not just opposition to marriage equality. This also means that the university cant white wash the speakers, if the university thinks that it is worthwhile to invite an extreme speaker then it needs to own that decision and not aid in any white washing of the speaker. So as long as we are clear on how far Ryan Anderson’s beliefs and actions really go I’m fine with having a discussion of his work so we can clearly point out just how flawed it is. The argument is an intellectual Pretzel that relies on artificial distinctions that were created purely for the purpose of making the argument work.|~|1|~|Sunday, November 10, 2013 8:47 AM|~|1116482411|~|NA|~|1
47773|~|scottrose|~|Ryan Anderson is a priest im Princeton Professor Robert George's apparently inviolable Church of Anti-LGBT Bigotry, Lies, and Incitements. Robert George's group the National Organization for Marriage -- founded in a same room on Nassau Street with The Witherspoon Institute -- sponsors anti-gay hate rallies where its chosen speakers yell through megaphones that homosexuals are "worthy to death."  One such Robert George-backed anti-gay hate rally can be viewed at the video at this link:      Play       Hide         |~|2|~|Sunday, November 10, 2013 2:51 PM|~|1116979404|~|1116482411|~|1
47773|~|scottrose|~|Ryan T. Anderson just like his mentor in gay-bashing hatred and bigotry Princeton's Robert George promulgates untrue statements about the history of the solemnization of same-sex unions.  The lies that these two figures spread  involving gay human beings are spread in violation of Princeton University's academic honor code, "Rights, Rules, and Responsibilities."  Freedom of speech in an academic community does not even remotely imply that scholars have a right to lie about the scholarly record of the history of a minority without being held academically accountable for the lies.  The notion that never before has any society on earth ever respected formalized same-sex unions -- a lie that Anderson and Robert George frequently repeat -- has been debunked umpteen times not just by anthropologists but in fact by the leading international professional society for anthropologists.  What has already marked Princeton University as a "farce" is the fact that it turns a blind eye to Professor Robert George's anti-gay lies as his very intolerance of LGBT human beings attracts oodles of right wing money to the university and its environs. Moreover, the editors of this publication should pause to consider whether "respectful discourse" is taking place when bigots argue against basic civil rights for an oppressed minority.  Princeton University has some additional, shameful anti-minority history, as the editors hopefully know.  |~|1|~|Sunday, November 10, 2013 8:13 AM|~|1116460147|~|NA|~|1

I am referring to the "tip" that you recently received about  http://inthenationsservice.org...  but that at least to date have done nothing about despite the issues that, with good justirication, it raises about instutional hypocrisy and intellectual dishonesty in Nassau Hall and elsewhere on campus.

47364|~|XAH '14|~|It always bothers me when people say that Asians "cluster" around other Asians on campus, as though it were something only 'we' do. Hardly anyone accuses white people on campus of clustering only with white people. "Man," the common refrain goes, "Why do you gotta hang out with so many Asians?" Gee, I don't know, probably for the same reason why you hang out with so many whites, only no one ever goes up to you and asks you that, because you're white (the 'you' here is just a general one, not directed at Ben). Wanting to scrub off the Asian identity is a fairly common sentiment. I assure you the same Asian Americans in CSA, KASA, TASA, AASA, etc etc have likely experienced it at one point or another. The fear of being stereotyped for being Asian is not going to go away by huddling in the corner of "Team White." Nor will it help dismantle such stereotypes if your friends see you as patently 'white'. To be perfectly honest, I think you're in the perfect position to blend the two identities and help break down the barriers of these stereotypes. You are, appearance-wise, Asian. The lesson you can teach others is that one's outward appearance does not define or indicate one's personality. If anyone remarks, "Oh, but you're Asian." So what? What does that have to do with anything? As though being Asian somehow means you can't like 'white culture' things. And to those who ask, "I know where you're from, but where are you really from", turn the awkwardness on them. Do not allow them to pigeonhole you or make you choose a 'team'. You're from wherever the hell you're from (Mystic, Connecticut?) and who are they to question that or push for more from you?|~|4|~|Tuesday, November 12, 2013 1:46 AM|~|1119138952|~|NA|~|1
